<h2>SUNY Stony Brook</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that spent its entire summer building a one-hundred foot tall Command Center while Faunce was renovated, it’s the Brown University “Jonas Brothers Award for Best Band in Providence County” BAAAAAND! 
</p>
<p>The band was extremely unhappy to find that besides creating a new website and a new School of Engineering, its university had spent the summer replacing all of the drinking fountains around campus with “hydration stations.” How are those of us without eco-friendly metal water bottles supposed to get our recommended eight glasses of water per day now? Oh, wait, we can’t drink water anyway because today happens to be Yom Kippur! Instead, have some Manischewitz, but only after the sun goes down! Watch as the Band celebrates this joyous Day of Atonement.
</p>
<p><i>Band forms Star of David and plays “Don’t Stop Believing.”
</i></p>
<p>But, aside from working these new improvements into our lives, there are some great things to do at Brown: join an a capella group, visit the frats on the weekend, sneak into FishCo with a fake, discover Wickenden Street after being a student here for four years… the list goes on and on. It’s the same situation over at Stonybrook, which was voted the Number 1 school in the “Things to do on the Weekend” category. Some examples of weekend activities: viewing the hilarious Dog Comedy Show at the Long Island Game Farm Zoo, furiously polluting onself, doing Jager Bombs in the Wang Center, and, if things get desperate, furiously taking matters into one’s own hands. What a broad list of extracurriculars!

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has better things to do with its time on weekends, it’s the Brown University “Bears Eat Seawolves for Breakfast” BAAAAAND!
</p>
<p>Now that the summer flicks are finally out of theaters, it’s time for the real Oscar-nominee material to start hitting the silver screen. One film that looks especially avant-garde is “Dances with Seawolves,” an uplifting tale of a young man thrown into the sea because he was too nouveau riche for West Egg. He befriends a colony of seawolves underwater, and with the help of his new amphibious mammalian friends, learns that while money can’t buy you happiness, a good strand of seaweed and some top-notch pirouettes can. But what will our protagonist do when the Long Island Game Farm Zoo wants to take his newfound family into custody?
</p>
<p><i>Band forms One Thumb Up and plays “Ding Dong Song.”
</i></p>
<p>While not quite Oscar material, this next film will certainly be a hit with thirteen-year-olds and cougar housewives—“Twilight: Seaclipse.” What will happen when totally average manatee Bella is forced to choose between brooding, sparkly Vampire-Shark Edward and muscular, but rather-more-ordinary Sea Werewolf Jacob? Worlds will collide as the University of Alaska Seawolf colony tries to recruit Jacob to the dark side and Edward starts to realize that sharks use manatees for food, not gratuitous snogging. How will Bella come to grips with the fact that seawolves are actually not wolves with tails, but instead strange eel-fish hybrids? 
</p>
<p><i>Band forms Bella the Manatee and plays “Ghostbusters.”
</i></p>
<p>The last exciting fall movie, opening only on Long Island as a special promotion, is “Seawolfman.” Antonio Banderas renders a heartbreaking performance as a man who, on every full moon, turns into a bloodthirsty seawolf who’s just looking for some love, and also some tasty victims. When his old rival, Bruno the Bearman, shows his intelligent and sexy face in town, will there be any hope for Seawolfman’s love life? Or will he be too busy terrorizing the residents of Suffolk County at every full moon to realize that Bruno has stolen his lady love from right under his nose? Watch now as the Brown Band celebrates Seawolfman’s defeat at Bruno’s hands.
</p>
<p><i>Band forms a 19 on the Orgo midterm and plays “#3.”
</i></p>
<p>Sadly, that’s all the previews we have for now. Join us next week as Brown takes on Harvard for Homecoming… we look a lot better in the dark!

<h2>Harvard</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has a restraining order against it that keeps it from approaching Harvard’s obnoxiously large drum, it’s the Brown University “So Good We’re Illegal” BAND!
</p>
<p>Well, looks it’s that time of the month again, folks—the Harvard game! We heard that Harvard had to put a dome onto its stadium to stop the crimson flow… hopefully we won’t have to do that here! We’ve got enough to worry about, what with our endowment shrinkage. You know what they say, though—it’s not the size of your endowment; it’s how you use it! Right, Harvard? Because, let’s be honest, folks, Harvard is the AIG of the Ivy League: “too big to fail.” Watch as the band celebrates the fact that WE won’t need a bailout.
</p>
<p><i>Band forms “Uppers” and plays “Beat It” 
</i></p>
<p>Harvard’s really been making a name for itself in rankings recently: it lost its position of “top university in the world” to Cambridge, lost the “Top School for Brainiacs” to Yale, was conspicuously missing from the “Top 25 Most Diverse Schools” and the “Top 25 Schools for Do-Gooders,” and, most shockingly, is the #4 Anti-Party School in the United States. That’s right, Harvard out-ranked MIT, Bringham Young University and even *#8* West Point. We all know about “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” but Harvard’s “You Talk, You Die” anti-party stance seems a little harsh. Watch now as the Band looks back on the good times we have. 
</p>
<p>Band forms a “B” and plays “#4.”

<div class="even"><h3>Halftime</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s just as astonished that this game is taking place at nighttime as you are, the Brown University “We Look Better in the Dark” BAND!
</p>
<p>We all know that this is Brown University’s first ever NIGHT GAME, but did you ever wonder why we haven’t played during the midnight hours before this very evening? Well, the Band suggests that we use the field for other things once the sun sets, like hosting SexPowerGod or providing a campground for the refugees of Hurricane Earl. What’s more, the Band would like to hold the always-special “Grass Fire,” an on-land counterpoint to “Water Fire” every Saturday. It’s for our glaucoma, we swear!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms “Medicine” and plays “Disco Inferno.”
</i></p>
<p>Another problem with night games in the past was the lighting situation. Unfortunately, Thomas Edison wasn’t a Brown Alumnus, and had we installed lights previous to this game, they would have to have been CFL’s, which don’t shine nearly bright enough. Next year, we encourage the Athletics Department to get creative with its lighting solutions: football players can wear glow-in-the-dark pants, have a Free Infrared Goggle giveaway, or have DPS place Blue Light Phones around the field, which will help if our players get tackled, too. But we’re lucky to have some lights now on this special occasion.
</p>
<p><i>Band forms “Portable Lights” and plays “Midnight Special.”
</i></p>
<p>Harvard has lights though, because they have money.  Fun fact: all graduates of the Harvard Business School have to take an Ethics Pledge upon graduation. Odd, considering no one at Harvard knows what “ethics” means.  We wonder what that pledge sounds like… “I, state your name, do solemnly swear not to do the following: 
<br>a) lie 
<br>b) cheat
<br>c) steal
<br>d) covet thy neighbor’s 401K
<br>e) ruin the lives of others
<br>f) THE PRINCETON BAND 
</p>
<p><i>Band forms a “B” and plays “In the Fray”
</i></p>
<p>Thanks for coming by for this historic game, everyone! Be sure to come on down to Kingston to see two football teams and one cup!

<h2>URI</h2>
<div class="even"><h3>Halftime</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves Mr. Rogers and his sweaters more than life itself, it’s the Brown University “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” BAAAAAAAAAND!
</p>
<p>Hello mon, we’re glad to be here in Kingston, Jamaica, again. Taking a trip to the Neighborhood of Make-Believe is always so much fun!  With your cool innovations like the QuadCam live campus video and your mob connections, there’s no place we’d rather be! But as good a neighbor as you are, we’d rather not visit more than once a year for the Governor’s Cup. Watch now as the band celebrates our visit to Providence Plantations!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms anchor and plays Uptown Girl (From C). Song length: 1:00
</i></p>
<p>Mr. Rogers isn’t the only one who knows about neighbors! Elizabeth Barrett Browning says, “A good neighbor sometimes cuts your morning up to mince-meat of the very smallest talk, then helps to sugar her bohea at night with your reputation.” Murray Kempton wisely states, “A neighborhood is where, when you go out of it, you get beat up.” Watch now as the band loves our neighbor!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms heart and plays Bad Romance (No Repeat). Song length: 1:10
</i></p>
<p>Finally, we’ll just remind everyone at URI just what a loving relationship our two schools have. We’re the Griffins to your Quagmire, your Simpsons to your Flanders, the South Korea to your North Korea and though we’re the Germany to your Russia, at least we don’t invade you every winter.  Or do we? Watch now as the band exalts in our supremacy!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms “B” and plays Bring the Victory. Song length: 0:44
</i></p>
<p>Thanks for watching, folks, and be sure to join us in two weeks as we take on Princeton. Grade inflator? I hardly know her!

<h2>Princeton</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that doesn’t restrict where its members can scrounge up a meal, it’s the Brown University “Please Sir, Can I Have Some More?” BAANNNNNNDDDD!
</p>
<p>Sorry, we know that dining club jokes aren’t terribly original. But, when your school has something like a Dining Club Taskforce, you’re asking for it! We know that you’re the “Hungry Hungry Tigers” of the Ivy League, but do you have dining clubs that accommodate the richly diverse student body of your fine university? Oh, wait… what diversity? Watch as the band celebrates Brown’s freedom of dinner choice and diversity!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms Number Muncher and plays “Any Way You Want It.”
</p></i>
<p>Unfortunately, while our students do have more dining opportunities, we have to pay an arm and a leg to attend the University. Not all of us have Mommy and Daddy’s loving support (and trust funds) at our full command! We know that not all Princeton students do either, which is why they should go searching for some tigers FAST! Did you know that 10 tiger phalluses—used in rare Eastern healing techniques—can pay for one year at Princeton? Time to get hunting!  Watch as the band is relieved that its university’s mascot isn’t such a hot commodity.
</p>
<p><i>Band forms a B and plays #3.

<div class="even"><h3>Halftime</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just recently got out of a messy divorce, it’s the Brown University “Single and Ready to Mingle” BAANNNNNDDDDD!
</p>
<p>Hello and welcome to the dating game, where our three mystery contestants will try to win the hearts of the band members. Contestant Number One, describe your dream date for the band. (In a guido voice:) “Well, after gettin’ MY NEW HAIRCUT, I tink that we won’t even have ta go on a date.  But, in case we do have to do somethin’, I guess we can hit up the gym and the band can watch me get my sweat on before DOIN’ SOME SERIOUS JAGERBOMBS!” (In regular announcer voice:) Well, thanks but no thanks, contestant number one. Or should I say PRINCETON? The Brown Band has more “thrilling” things to do on Saturday nights!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms a Jagerbomb and plays “Thriller.”
</i></p>

<p>Now, Contestant Number Two, the Brown Band is rather politically-minded, so some political intelligence would be nice. What do you think about the current state of affairs in the United States? (Just make dumb sounds:) “Uhh, *blow a raspberry* aksdfjlakjfalkdjfalkdjfaldfjld.” (In regular announcer voice:) Get outta here, PENN! Nobody likes you and the band will never date you, not if we were the last two people on earth!  Watch as the band gets its groove on without contestant number two!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms the average Penn GPA (D+) and plays “Vehicle.”
</i></p>

<p>And, finally, contestant number three, it’s all down to you. Why should we pick you? (In voice that exudes awesomeness:) 
<br>A) Elrod Snidley. 
<br>B) Ruth Simmons. 
<br>C) We ranked higher than Princeton in the Trojan Sexual Health report. 
<br>D) We bang AND blow! 
<br>E) Motorcyclists on Thayer beat guidos any day of the week. 
<br>F) THE PRINCETON BAND!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms a B and plays “Brown Man Born.”
</i></p>
<p>Looks like contestant three, BROWN, has won the dating game! As if there were ever any doubt… Join us next week as we take on Cornell at home.  Ithaca may be “gorges,” but we prefer the safety of Providence!

<h2>Cornell</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that appreciates the alumni of Cornell, it’s the Brown University “Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill Nye the Science Guy!” BAND!
</p>

<p>Because Cornell is a roughly 98.3% state and 1.7% private school, there are some disparities in the quality of education between our two universities. For example, here are some things one can learn at Cornell: 
<br>-How can a clam cram in a clean cream can?
<br>-Picky people pick Peter Pan Peanut-Butter, 'tis the peanut-butter picky people pick.
<br>-The big black bug bit the big black bear, but the big black bear bit the big black bug back!
<br>And everybody’s favorite…
<br>-Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers! 
<br>PHEW!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms Erhlenmeyer Flask and plays “Johnny B. Goode.”
</i></p>

<p>That’s right, folks, Cornell students sit around saying tongue-twisters all day! At Brown, we like to prove how intelligent we are in a different manner.
<br>A.	Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
<br>B.	Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
<br>C.	Hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian

<br>E.	Antidisestablishmentarianism and

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that was not eaten by its parents, it’s the Brown University “Thank G-d We’re Not Hamsters!” BAAAANNNNDDDDD!
</p>
<p>It’s that time of year again, the beloved Parents’ Weekend! Let us just warn you, though, a few things have changed since you saw us last. We’re sorry to disappoint, because we know how badly you want us to get jobs and become real adults, but we’re majoring in unemployment and alcoholism. Also, we’ve decided to stop calling you “mom and dad” because here at Brown, we believe that true parenting is a spectrum. Far be it from us to fall into the cultural hegemony of parenting! But, wait… who’s the hottie with the body sitting in the stands over there? That’s right, I’m looking at you, Stacy’s Mom… Dad… parental figure… oh, whatever…
</p>
<p><i>Band forms "HI MOM" and plays “Stacy’s Mom.”
</p></i>
<p>Look out, band, it’s everyone’s worst nightmare who’s come to visit for the weekend… the Jewish Mother! (in a Jewish mother voice) ELROD SNIDLEY, YOU GET YOUR LITTLE TUCCHUS OVER HERE RIGHT NOW. I’ve just been to your room, and the place is filthy! Oy vey, the things I have to do to take care of my son. By the way, I’ve been down to the new Stephen Robert Campus Center, you know, the one in Faunce Arch? That building is beeeeeeauuuutiful! I bet you’ll find some nice Shaynas studying there! Just don’t put milk and cheese on the foccacia sandwhiches… Keep it kosher! (in regular announcer voice) Come on, Eileen—I mean Mrs. Goldsteinowitz—leave us alone already! 
</p>
<p><i>Band forms Guilty Face plays “Come On Eileen.”
</p></i>
<p>Thank goodness we got rid of her! All that guilt gets difficult to deal with. You know what else is difficult to deal with? The pressure of being a second-rate university. Where were we? Oh, yes. Cornell, did you know that you are living a lie? Contrary to Frederick Rudolph’s view, you’re not the “First American University;” you’re not even the first Cornell! Cornell College, located in Iowa, was founded four years before Cornell University. They only take one class at a time, that still manages to be more rigorous than the one up in Ithaca! That’s what you get for living on a farm. Watch now, parents, as your children celebrate Brown’s utter pwnage of Cornell.
</p>
<p><i>Band forms a top tenth percentile average at Cornell and plays Brown Bear.
</p></i>
<p>Parents, it’s been lovely having you here! Be sure to check back next week as we head down to the City of Brotherly Love to take on the meatheads at UPenn! Quaker? I hardly know ‘er!

While we never like to visit the City of Brotherly Love, we can appreciate its rich history, especially that of its model citizen, Benjamin Franklin! We’re here to bring you some revisionist history with a list of things Benjamin Franklin DIDN’T invent:

</p>
<p><br>—There once was a school named Yale at which was consumed much ale. Not better than Brown, they fell to the ground, and then the Brown Band said, “Yuck. Fail.”
<br>—There once was a student from Yale who had been beaten up by a pail. When he tried to date, he could not find a mate; the girl asked, “Are you sure you’re a male?”
<br>—There once was a quaint place called Yale; its endowment was huge as a whale! Unfortunately, as all others could see, all Yalies have the smarts of a nail.
</p>

<p><i>Band forms The Cat in the Hat's Hat and plays “Fat Bottomed Girls.”

<p>Dear Yale, on behalf of everyone everywhere, we’d just like to point out that “no” means “no.” Seriously. We know that George Dubya went to your school and all, but how stupid do you have to be? At least now we can understand why a SWAT team had to break up one of your parties. Don’t taze me, bro! But, really, Yale, how unclassy can you get?  Your researchers recently found a genetic trigger for depression—it must be Yale itself! How could anyone live there and NOT be unhappy when your students act the way they do? It’s not sexy. And neither is New Haven.  BOOM ROASTED.
</p>
<p><i>Band forms a tazer and plays Ding Dong Song.
</p></i>
<p>[Jumpy Circle] On another note, Brown is currently so much poorer than Yale that the Brown Band had to turn to alternative revenue sources. We have a lot of members, so we decided to take our new business to SPG. In celebration of our recent employment, the band is wearing our risqué uniforms—you’ll notice shorter socks today, jackets unbuttoned in a daring fashion and, oh, my, is Benny G showing some wrist while he conducts? The impropriety!

The confused and uppity Yalies asked the valiant bandies to point them in the direction of some entertainment—the adult kind. Apparently, strip clubs in Providence are better than those in New Haven! But, wait, Yale, you know what’s better than strip clubs in Providence? Taking her to dinner, getting her consent, and SCORING BEARS SCORING! Oh, sorry, that’s hetero-normative. Here at Brown, it’s a spectrum!

<p>Apparently, over the summer, the police department in Hanover re-enacted the popular YouTube video “Leeroy Jenkins.” They bravely raided the frats for artifacts such as the Divine Shoulders and Keystone Light, and did so by using underage kids to facilitate sting operations. They must have had plus-one charisma to pull that one off! The valiant police clan also accosted drunkards who had been EMS’d and arrested them on the spot… it’s a good thing Dartmouth encourages its students to make smart decisions.

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that can’t decide how to ford the river, it’s the Brown University “Caulk it and Float!!” BAND! 
</p>

<p>In order to get to Hanover, the Band had to play a rousing game of “Appalachian Trail.” We started the journey at the Fulton Outpost, and made our way slowly because it was the dead of winter. We went hunting for food and shot ten thousand pounds of moose, but could only carry back one hundred. Some of the Bandies died of rabies after being kicked in the face by a sheep, and others got cholera because of too much partying. We managed to make it to an outpost, but couldn’t trade with the local frat boys because we ran out of our prime bartering material, alcohol. Finally, we had to ford the Connecticut River, but because we didn’t caulk and float, we lost all of our belongings. It’s a miracle we made it here on time, really.
</p>

<p><i>Band forms an amorphous blob and plays "Midnight Special."

<p>While on our treacherous journey along the Appalachian Trail, we got lost several times. In our peril, we found some strange artifacts that seem to be specific to Hanover: a moose colony, a pile of stolen coats, snow, a wasteland, sticks, pine trees, Keystone, Maine, and “Daniel Webster, Baby Eater.” Thank G-d we don’t live here! We might die of boredom. Or alcohol poisoning. Or both.</p>

<p>This year, the Band spent quite a lot of time on busrides. Our away trips were supposed to be relatively uneventful, but due to long hours stuck in traffic and short tempers, we learned a few choice life lessons that we’d like to share. 
<br>A.	Never try to mess with Marcellus Wallace.
<br>B.	Do not, under any circumstances, snort heroin. Ever.
<br>C.	If Samuel L. Jackson says you’ve got one tasty burger, you better agree with him.
<br>D.	Quentin Tarantino loves shameless self-promotion.
<br>E.	If some jerk attempts a carjacking in the middle of I-95, the band is bound to collectively pop a vital body part, and…
<br>F.	THE PRINCETON BAND.

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wishes its seniors would all stay at Brown and get PhDs, it’s the Brown University “Four more years! Four more years!” BAAANNNNDDDD!
</p>

<p><i>Band forms a champagne glass and plays Bits and Pieces for each senior Limerick.

<p>
<i>Eli Bashevkin:</i> That dumb trumpet player named Eli<br>
what an odd stupid and fat ugly guy.<br>
In love with the car team<br>
he makes Emily scream<br>
and when with her in bed he is so spry.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sabrina Boyd:</i> The bisectional Sabby B <br>
is as smooth as a piece of fine Brie.<br>
Works for BRU<br>
she’s more famous than you<br>
and is always welcome to whip me.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Bryan Chu:</i> There once was a senior named Chu;<br>
into many instruments he blew.<br>
It caused lots of commotion:<br>
shameless self-promotion.<br>
To him we’ll remain ever true.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Matt Edelman:</i> There once was a drummer named Matt<br>
Who can’t tell a sharp from a flat.<br>
He loved throwing discs,<br>
Despite all the risks.<br>
We’ll give him a tip of our hat.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Emily Haskell:</i> There is this girl Emily Haskell. <br>
Broke her collarbone<br>
—what a rascal!<br>
Spent last semester in China, <br>
she’s got a really nice *pause* nose<br>
and is as smart as that math guy Pascal.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sara Hoffman:</i> Sara Hoffman, now where could you be?<br>
We know that you live with Wendy.<br>
You’re there for dear Paul <br>
but not Band at all…<br>
Maybe you are stuck in a tree!<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Mike Johnson:</i> Mike Johnson stands out in a crowd; <br>
when the band’s late he gets very loud.<br>
His birthday we liked! <br>
Mike mike mike mike mike.<br>
We assume that he’s quite well-endowed.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Wendy Kwartin:</i> Hey Mom, Doctor Rally the Dubs,<br>
we’d like to see you in da clubs.<br>
Vag Squad is the best—<br>
it shames all the rest—<br>
and on the trump you never make flubs.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Max Mankin:</i> There once was a dear prez named Max<br>
who knew many chemistry facts.<br>
He was quite a cutie <br>
with such a nice booty<br>
and height is not something he lacks.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Will Miller:</i> A bandie, Will Miller, did drink<br>
Way more than you’d possibly think<br>
He handled our cash,<br>
Whipped it out in a flash,<br>
So to him our glasses we clink.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Chris Moynihan:</i> Though for years Chris’s drum was a bass<br>
He never once fell on his face.<br>
A great engineer <br>
like the girl he holds dear,<br>
He always rolls off with such grace.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Aminy Ostfeld:</i> Aminy, now great-great grandmom,<br>
She always made Brown Band the bomb.<br>
She’s a hell of a trump,<br>
and never a grump,<br>
she’s got Chris eating out of her palm.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sara Powell:</i> There once was a judge named Sara,<br>
Who spent time near the French Riviera,<br>
As our rec sec so witty,<br>
but a bit itty bitty,<br>
we’re sad it’s the end of her era.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Dan Prendergast:</i> There once was a Prendergast: Dan.<br>
Of you we are such a big fan.<br>
He’s the Baritone queen<br>
and loves Come On Elieen<br>
and if you need 40s he’s your man.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Ignatio Santana:</i> His real name is Nacho, we swear,<br>
He really could bang … on a snare.<br>
He’ll still be at Brown<br>
so we’ll see him around<br>
though he’s now moving on to health care<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Shaun Verch:</i> Hey, do you guys remember Shaun Verch?<br>
He’s so tall birds use him as a perch.<br>
He plays mellophone <br>
such a beautiful tone<br>
and he could code us Google Search.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sam Winograd:</i> There once was a Clarinet Sam,<br>
to his clarinet tunes we would jam.<br>
As great a VP<br>
as a Wolf-Bear can be,<br>
he’ll be sorely missed in our fam.<br>
</p>
