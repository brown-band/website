<small><em>Saturday, September 21, 1996</em></small></a></h1>

<h2><em>Pregame:</em></h2>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, presenting an organization that can dance
the Macarena better than Al Gore, it's the Brown University &quot;hey watch it, that was
my foot!&quot; Band! </p>

<p><strong>[Band (light on its feet) enters from sideline, forms football] </strong></p>

<p><strong>[Band plays &quot;NFL Today&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>And now the band will do its impression of a Bulldog drinking out of the Yale Bowl. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms &quot;Y,&quot; plays &quot;Bulldogs, Bulldogs&quot;. . . bottom of
&quot;Y&quot; splits off and forms an &quot;o&quot; next to it, spelling &quot;Yo&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Welcome to another exciting year of Brown football! </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms &quot;B,&quot; plays #3] </strong></p>

<p><strong>[Band plays #1, marches off field] </strong></p>

<h2><em>Halftime:</em></h2>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, presenting the only organization that quotes
Kierkegaard more often than President Gregorian, it's the Brown University &quot;sound of
one hand clapping&quot; Band! </p>

<p><strong>[Band philosophically strides onto field] </strong></p>

<p>Recently the band has been pondering the meaning of life. We are sure we are not alone
in this however, as the Yale Band probably wonders whether their lives have any meaning
every day. Nonetheless we have set out on a search for the answers to life's
imponderables, like: 

<ul>
  <li>Why are we here? </li>
  <li>What is the nature of reality? </li>
  <li>What in the world was the staff of US News and World Report smoking? <br>
    and </li>
  <li>What is the Ratty cheese sauce really made of? </li>
</ul>

<p>First we sought for answers at the traveling Smithsonian exhibit which has stopped in
Providence. Unfortunately, there is a long list of things we didn't find there. Here are
some of them: 

<ul>
  <li>Lounge space in First-year dorms </li>
  <li>Bob Dole's chances of getting elected </li>
  <li>Providence Mayor &quot;Buddy&quot; Cianci's ashtray </li>
  <li>Ross Perot's chances of being noticed </li>
  <li>The meaning of life <br>
    and </li>
  <li>Yale mascot Handsome Dan XIV </li>
</ul>

<p>Watch now as the band forms the dialectic play of thesis and antithesis and plays
&quot;Hegel's Mambo.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms diagram of Hegel's dialectic and plays &quot;Johnny's Mambo&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Next we tried to find meaning in so-called extreme sports. Unfortunately we learned
that next year's Extreme Games will be taking place in New Haven. While the Extreme Games
in Providence included such events as street luge and synchronized bungee-jumping, the New
Haven Extreme Games will have bullet dodging, getting food at a dining hall, the mugger
slalom, and having a grad student grade your term paper. </p>

<p>Another philosophical question that has plagued us recently is the epistemological
problem of Yale's existence. [pause] While there seems to be plenty of evidence to support
it we believe there is ample room for doubt. True, our last two presidents claim to be
Yale graduates, but their respective performances in office suggest a complete lack of
education. This does not prove that Yale doesn't exist, however, because it is consistent
with the level of academic rigor supposedly found there. Watch now as the band forms John
Rawls' veil of ignorance and plays &quot;Subjective Man Born.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms veil and plays &quot;Brown Man Born&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Plagued with uncertainty, we finally made a journey to aromatic New Haven to see for
ourselves. Our experience there was reminiscent of a trip to the movie theatre. The
streets were like the aftermath of a Twister: maybe the aliens from Independence Day blew
up New Haven and nobody noticed. In any case we all had to show Courage Under Fire because
the lifestyle was straight out of Trainspotting. For a while we thought it would be a
Mission: Impossible ever to Escape From New Haven, but we did finally reach the spot of
the alleged university only to find what appeared to be a penitentiary of some sort. Watch
now as the Brown Band presents the Yale Jail as Jericho in hopes that the house of cards
that is its reputation will soon come crumbling down. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms big wall and plays &quot;Joshua&quot;] </strong></p>

<p><strong>[Band forms &quot;B&quot; during following latin gibberish] </strong></p>

<p>QED: Quando erat demonstrandum. Cogito ergo sum. Quid pro quo. Ex post facto. Arma
virumque cano. In java speramus. Semper ubi sub ubi. And in conclusion, we suspect that
Yale University is actually a large-scale hoax perpetrated by either the CIA, the
Illuminati, or the well known super-secret society Skull and Bones. [one member of the
band discreetly leaves the formation and walks off the field] Join us next week to see the
band braves the killer-mosquito infested wilds of Southern Rhode Island when the bears
take on URI. Until then, we would like to join the humane society in reminding you to have
your Bulldog spayed or neutered. </p>

Who else would try to rhyme symmetry with eye? <br>
Maybe it was his immortal hand <br>
that framed the BROWN UNIVERSITY BAND! </p>

<p><strong>[Band pounces onto field] </strong></p>

<p>The Brown Band can't even begin to express its pleasure to be performing at the College
of New Jersey, especially as a show of solidarity against our fellow Ivy Leaguers who are
selfishly trying to rob you of your name. It is truly absurd to think that anybody would
ever confuse Princeton and the College of New Jersey. In fact, anybody who made that kind
of mistake would have to be a complete and utter. . . What? Oh. . . never mind! </p>

<p>Watch now as the band forms New Jersey and plays &quot;Time Warp&quot; to give me time
to think up some Princeton jokes. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms New Jersey, plays &quot;Time Warp&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>As the OJ Simpson case finds a ghoulish new life in civil court, the band can't help
but be reminded of such ghoulish, parasitic creatures as vampires, zombies, Kato Caelin,
and deans in charge of housing. Upon viewing the architecture at Princeton, we can hardly
imagine a location more suited for any of the above mentioned creatures. We can only
imagine, however, that a vampire at Princeton would demand that his victim had a martini
before he drank their blood. </p>

<p>Watch now as the Brown University Anemic Band does its salute to bloodsuckers
everywhere by forming a straw and playing the &quot;In The Neck.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms straw and plays &quot;In The Fray&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Guess what kids? SAT time is coming up! In honor of Princeton, home of ETS, we would

Shaw&#146;s Family Day families, presenting an organization with absolutely no street
cred, it&#146;s the Brown University Sellout Band! </p>

<p><strong>[Band charges field (on Visa or Mastercard)] </strong></p>

<p>Last season, if you recall, the Brown Band, out of a heartfelt love for the product,
did a halftime show salute to Nantucket Nectars, which led Tom &amp; Tom to supply us with
a years supply of their fine drink. Since then, many other companies have approached us
offering enormous sums for endorsements. Of course we refused. While some people get their
Kix making money, we take no Joy in the rising Tide of crass commercialism and hope that
it has already reached its Zenith. We prefer to Bounce back, remain Spic&#146;N&#146;Span,
even though the Bounty offered is often quite Brawny. We hope you will all Cheer us on in
our effort to remain true to our art. </p>

<p>Speaking of our art, watch now as the band forms a PEZ dispenser and salutes disco. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms PEZ dispenser, plays &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>OK, you found us out. It was actually the Brown Band disguised as Roberto Alomar who
hocked a loogie on that umpire. It really was the Brown Band who tripped Bob Dole on his
way to the podium. It was in fact the Brown Band who stole the world&#146;s largest ball
of lint from the Smithsonian. It was really the Brown Band who suspended a first-grader
for sexual harassment. It was indeed the Brown Band with Sandy Duncan in that commercial
for Spam-flavored Wheat Thins. The Brown Band does sit too close to the television. The
Brown Band even replaced the T-shirts being launched into the crowd with its own dirty
laundry. In fact, the Brown Band followed in Dave Letterman&#146;s footsteps by marketing
its own Brown Band Brand Canned Ham. It&#146;s priced low enough so that you can buy it
even if you ordinarily can&#146;t afford ham. </p>

<p>Watch now as the Brown Band brings home the bacon and plays &quot;Bring the
Profit&quot; </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms dollar sign, plays &quot;Bring the Victory&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>At this point we were considering a joke about the presidential election. Then we
realized something. The elction isn&#146;t funny. It&#146;s not exciting. It&#146;s really
just plain depressing. Rather than considering a choice between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton,
we will concentrate on more uplifting things, like the inevitable heat death of the
universe, jagged little twit Alannis Morisette&#146;s ascent to the top of the pop charts,
and the Russian astronauts indefinately stranded on the space station Mir because Russia
can&#146;t afford to get them down. Isn&#146;t that better. If that fails you can just be
glad the Brown Band isn&#146;t an a capella group. </p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and Harvard students, presenting an

<p><strong>[Band forms package, plays &quot;Vehicle&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Watch now, ladies and gentlemen, as the Brown Band spontaneously combusts. </p>

<p><strong>[Package explodes] </strong></p>

<p>If somebody wants something strongly enough, in certain situations they seek to sell
their soul to Satan. At Harvard they don&#146;t place stock in such silliness, but they do
have the next best thing-- groveling to Gates. </p>

<p>It might have come to some as a surprise how Harvard garnered a healthy bequest from
Bill for their new building, leaving a once-mighty university on its knees to a modern-day
Mephistopheles. We may even wonder: How hard up was Harvard to go to Goethe and unfurl the
Faust flag? It certainly wasn&#146;t out of a thirst for knowledge (this is, after all,
Harvard we&#146;re talking about). </p>

<p>More likely it was one of the seven deadly sins: We suspect that the Crimsons envied
Brown, although they were not driven (as one might suspect) by envy for Brown&#146;s
renowned Computer Science department, but rather by Harvard&#146;s hankering to have a big
ugly hole in the ground of their very own. That fraud Freud never mentioned anything about
crater envy, but it has been the downfall of many a virtuous university. </p>

<p>Watch now, ladies and gentlemen, as the Brown University Microsoft Band forms a great

<p>This year marks John Keats&#146; 200th anniversary, and the Brown Band&#146;s crack
team of literary historians has recently unearthed a previously unknown collaboration
between John Keats and John Harvard. It turns out that it was the two Johns working
together who wrote the little-known masterpiece &#147;Commode on a Grecian Urn.&#148; The
lyric deals with a Greek vase being brought to the Peabody Museum by a Harvard student.
Tragedy strikes when the student tries to take the train and ends up drowning because he
never needed to use the library. </p>

anyway. Just be glad that we&#146;re playing for more than five people. </p>

<p>Next we have Mike Radwin. You&#146;ll just have to trust me when I say he looks better
in a skirt. If he can&#146;t get a job at MicroSoft, Mike looks forward to employment as
the next posterboy for Zima. </p>

<p>Finally we have Arik Zwirner... finally because his name is the last on any conceivable
alphabetical list. Just remember folks, [a la Arnold Schwarzenneger in &quot;Kindergarten

<p>And so we bid them good luck in whatever they may attempt. May the wind always be at
their backs, or at least keep them well downwind. All joking aside, they serve as
reminders of what will happen to to the rest of us when we too accumulate thirty credits.

BAND! </p>

<p><strong>[Band integrates field] </strong></p>

<p>After considering numerous possibilities for this week&#146;s show, including musical
salutes to topics including, but not limited to, free range carrots, various inflatable
objects, vegan stew (mmm, vegans), comedian Jeff Foxworthy&#146;s incredibly lame brand of
redneck humor, and 101 things to do with a great big hole in the ground, the Brown Band
finally settled on a salute to all things geeky. </p>

<p>What&#146;s that you say? A salute to Dartmouth? No, no, a salute to all things geeky,
not Greeky! </p>

<p>We&#146;ll start off with physics, because the band has a lot in common with light. You
see, sometimes we behave like a particle [Band squeezes together in middle of field] and
sometimes like a wave [Band does the wave]. Watch now as the band salutes physics and
scientific experimentation in general by reenacting the two slit experiment all day and
all of the night. </p>

<p><strong>[Band demonstrates paradoxical quantum behavior of photons shot through two
slits in a carboard barrier and plays &quot;All Day and All of the Night.&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Because of our interest in all things geeky, the band was very interested to hear that
Dartmouth College has finally set a release date for the long delayed BASIC &#145;96.
It&#146;s designers promise that BASIC &#145;96 is destined to change the way first
graders and Dartmouth students use computers, although detractors say that it&#146;s
nothing more than LOGO &#145;89. As for the computing needs of the Brown Band, we prefer
Unix. </p>

<p>What&#146;s that you say? Doesn&#146;t that hurt? No, no... not those kind of eunuchs,
Unix the operating system! </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms &quot;X^2&quot; (x squared) on field] </strong></p>

<p>Humor has always been an integral part of the Brown Band, but it has come to our
attention that some people accuse us of being derivative. Watch now as we differentiate
ourselves. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms &quot;2X,&quot; plays &quot;In The Fray&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Of course no salute to all things geeky would be complete without reference to Star
Trek. In less than a week the boys at Paramount will release a new Trek film on the
unsuspecting masses. Trekkies, Trekkers and Tribbles everywhere wait with baited breath to
see what happens when the crew travels back in time in order to prevent Boris Yeltsin from
getting back on the sauce. Will Worf be able to take down Janet Reno in single combat? Can
Data show more emotion than Al Gore? Who are more ruthless, the Borg or the Republican
Congress? And of course the ultimate question on everybody&#146;s mind: [dramatic pause]
Can Captain Kirk continue to pick up women from beyond the grave? </p>

Don&#146;t want old Boutros to run the UN </p>

<p>Old Bob Dole <br>
Was a sour old soul <br>
And a sour old man was he <br>
He called for a tax cut <br>
Talked up family values <br>
But still couldn&#146;t find victory </p>

<p>Sing a song of Clinton, let&#146;s make him a big cake <br>
Four and twenty Grad Students set out for to bake <br>
When the bake was finished one Grad said to the rest <br>
&quot;Hope this cake is really good &#145;cause I just missed my test!&quot; </p>

<p>Watch now as the Brown Band disses the butcher and the candlestick maker and salutes
the baker, and the voters of California, by forming a cake and playing &quot;Brown Man
Baked.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms cake and plays &quot;Brown Man Born&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Baa baa green sheep <br>
Have you any band? <br>
Yes sir, yes sir <br>
They play Hawaii 5-0 on demand </p>

<p>Boris, Boris, with liver porous, <br>
How does your country run? <br>
&quot;With vodka glasses and heart bypasses <br>
And KGB files on everyone.&quot; </p>

<p>Hickory dickory dock <br>
The band was watching the clock <br>
So if our show runs overtime <br>
You all can... </p>

<p>Watch now as the Brown Band forms what&#146;s left of Boris Yeltsin&#146;s liver and
tries to turn back time. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms &quot;B&quot; and plays &quot;Timewarp&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>And now ladies and gentlemen, sit tight for the next component of the half-time
festivities: No, they&#146;re not refugees from the East Side, they&#146;re a group of the
only musicians on Earth more confused than Michael Jackson... as for the Brown Band,
we&#146;ll see you all next season! </p>
