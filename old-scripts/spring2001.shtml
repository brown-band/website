<center><b>Skating Show vs. Colgate</b></center>
<br>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that
<br>flosses daily, it's the Brown University "say ahhh!!!" <b>(band says 
"aaaah")</b> Band!
<br>
<br><b>(Band skates on to the ice)</b>
<br>
<br>To maintain the integrity of our humor the brown band pledges to make no
<br>jokes about toothpaste or the recent presidential election. In fact, we
<br>resolve to place all of our toothpaste and election jokes in a lockbox,
<br>where they will be safe for the next fifty years. We'll try to focus on
<br>hockey for now.
<br>
<br>9 out of 10 hockey seasons prove that the Colgate team has trouble
<br>protecting behind the blue line; The new contoured head of the Brown
<br>offense, however, complete with ribbed bristles, can give maximum access
<br>into those hard-to-reach crevices, while the Brown defense brushes 
away the
<br>unsightly red raider buildup. Watch now as the band cleans up that big,
<br>sticky mess and plays "Don't Build Me Up, Buttercup."
<br>
<br><b>(Band does funky smile thing and plays buttercup)</b>
<br>
<br>As effective as our Brown team may be, for those really tough cleanup 
jobs
<br>there's just no substitute for high-powered explosives. In fact, some 
of the
<br>toughest cleanup jobs in history have involved high-powerd explosives 
on the
<br>beaches of our fine nation. Watch now as the band pays tribute to the 
Coast
<br>Guard's dinamyte ingenuity and plays "You Can Call Me Ishmael"
<br>
<br><b>(Band forms exploding whale and plays "Al")</b>
<br>
<br>Look, ma, no more whale! Now that we've cleaned things up we'd like to
<br>invite the Colgate team to a conciliatory banquet of whale meat, 
sugar-free
<br>gum, and vegan brown rice pilaf, guaranteed to leave your teeth shiny and
<br>white. Watch now as the band forms a B for "brush regularly" and plays
<br>For Bruno and For Brown.
<br>
<br><b>(Band does this)</b>
<br>
<br>Join us for next week's basketball game as the Brown Bears take on the
<br>Columbia Lions in the Pizzatola gym.
<br>
<br><b>(Band leaves to Ever True)</b>
