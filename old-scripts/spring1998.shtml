Rensselaer<br>
</big><em>February 6, 1998</em></big></strong></big></a></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization
that gets knocked down, but gets up again, it&#146;s the Brown University &quot;flirting
with&#133; disaster&quot; Band!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Band skates onto ice, and Kyle barely averts disaster)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This show will be a salute to disasters. We promise, however, not to
say anything about Bill Clinton&#146;s latest disaster, the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But speaking of things with a high price tag, the Brown Band recently
saw James Cameron&#146;s new movie &quot;Titanic&quot;. We understand that producing
&quot;Titanic&quot; was almost as expensive as a Brown education. However, the film
recovered all of its costs within a few weeks. We can only hope the same for ourselves.
For those of you that haven&#146;t yet seen the movie, the Brown Band wants to apologize
for revealing the ending in this week&#146;s show. You may want to cover your ears while
we read the next line.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(<i>Pause</i>)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(<i>Deeper voice</i>) The boat sinks.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Band will now reenact the story of the Titanic taking its maiden (<i>pause</i>)
voyage, from Liverpool to New York.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(<i>Band forms Titanic</i>)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look out, Band! Ice!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(<i>Band looks down [exaggeratedly] and screams in terror.</i>)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hold on to your lifeboats, everyone, and watch now as the Band plays
on.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(<i>Band plays &quot;Peter Gunn Theme&quot;. The Band then moves
forward, ie &quot;sinks&quot;.</i>)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A little-known fact of history is that the Titanic was an engineering
design project of RPI students. In fact, the Titanic&#146;s original destination was not
New York, New York, but Troy, New York, home of Rensselaer. Plans were changed when it was
realized that THIS Troy didn&#146;t have a harbor. However, we still enjoyed watching the
Brown hockey team sack the Trojans. On this, the hundredth anniversary season of Brown
hockey, we&#146;d like to salute the spirit of good sportsmanship by forming our
opponent&#146;s initials and playing &quot;Brown Bear&quot;.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(<i>Band forms &quot;RIP&quot; and plays &quot;Brown Bear&quot;.)</i></p>


<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another great disaster of recent weeks was <u>Vanity Fair</u>&#146;s
grossly inaccurate portrayal of Brown. We all know that Brown students actually drive
Jaguars, not Porsches, and take weekend trips to Venice, not Paris. And the article
completely neglected the Brown Band, who recently returned from a world tour with Brown
alums Duncan Sheik and Lisa Loeb. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(<i>pause</i>)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They opened for us. We toured New York and Tokyo. We didn&#146;t go to
Paris, of course; it&#146;s just so blasé now.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, there&#146;s no need to be defensive about <u>Vanity Fair</u>&#146;s
portrayal of Brown. We&#146;ll just let the article speak for itself. In the words of
Jennet Conant, &quot;What&#146;s behind the explosion of BMWs and Chanel jackets on its
once quiet campus?&quot; (<i>pause</i>) Watch now as the Brown Band forms an exploding BMW
and plays &quot;Fire.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(<i>Band forms BMW, explodes, and plays &quot;Fire.&quot;</i>)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, it&#146;s time for us to leave now. If we stay any longer,
we&#146;ll probably get a parking ticket. Join us February 20 as Brown takes on Cornell
Big Red Disasters, and the Band offers emergency musical assistance. Watch now as the Band
forms all that&#146;s left of the BMW and plays &quot;Ever True to Brown.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization
with an ego problem AND an id problem, it&#146;s the Brown University &quot;Freud where
prohibited&quot; Band!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, the Band has begun to psychoanalyze itself, as we are quite
disturbed by the fact that every time the percussion section plays the bells, we start to
salivate. We decided that the best way to solve the problem would be to analyze this show.
Close scrutiny revealed bad psychology puns and many talented <i><b>(thick accent,
emphasis)</b></i> Jung musicians, but no Sexuality and Society concentrators. We must be
repressed. Watch now as the band salutes the science of psychology by forming a Rorschach
inkblot test and playing &quot;Johnny&#146;s Superego.&quot; </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Band forms inkblot and plays &quot;Johnny&#146;s Mambo&quot;)</p></b></i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this week&#146;s show, we want to talk about the Big Red Rock.
It&#146;s far from civilization, it&#146;s cold, it&#146;s deserted, and it has a really
big gorge. The Brown Band wants to dedicate this portion of the show to <i><b>(pause)</b></i>
Mars. We find it remarkable that Mars bears such a resemblance to a certain obscure school
in upstate New York. In fact, the biggest scientific controversy that has come to light in
recent months is the <i><b>question (dramatic voice)</b></i>: Is there life on Cornell?
The late astronomer Carl Sagan said, &quot;yes, I think so...&quot; <i><b>(businesslike,
scientific TV program narrator tone)</b></i> The Brown Band had doubted this conclusion,
and decided to challenge the hypothesis. In conjunction with Brown&#146;s world-renowned
Planetary Geology Department, we launched a mission to Cornell, equipped with a &#145;Red
Rover,&#146; designed to bring us a sample right over. In short, sample analysis found the
Cornell rock teeming with &quot;billions and billions&quot; of students. The only question
that remains it whether or not Big Red harbors intelligent life. Watch now as the Band
forms a big red planet and plays &quot;Starblazers.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking of stars, some of the world&#146;s finest athletes gathered
recently in Nagano, Japan for the 18th Winter Olympics. <i><b>(smooth announcer voice)</b></i>
Our coverage is brought to you by the Brown Band Broadcasting Corporation. Our guarantee,
something no other network can claim: we promise to bring you at least 5 minutes of actual
Olympic events EVERY HOUR!! Our exciting Olympic coverage will begin with a sport newly
added to the Olympic Games: curling! In fact, we hear that soon to follow will be
crimping, manicures, and... What? Ohhhh! Never mind. Anyway, another first in the Olympic
lineup is women&#146;s ice hockey, with Brown&#146;s Tara Mounsey and Katie King on the
gold-medal winning US team. And in yet another first-time sport, Canadian snowboarder Ross
Rebagliati, whose gold medal had been revoked when he tested positive for marijuana use,
had it restored when it was realized that marijuana is not a performance-ENHANCING
substance. And we would like to propose a new event for the next winter games:
synchronized ice banding.</p>
<i><b>

<b>(Inane announcer voice)</b></i> Watch now as the Brown Band performs
their extremely difficult skating program by forming One-Olympic-Ring playing &quot;Bring
the Victory,&quot; the same song that won them the gold medal in their last skating show.
Now, this band has overcome many obstacles to be here today. The entire trombone section
was raised by wolves, and the president of the band had his car towed away earlier this
year, but he&#146;s made an incredible comeback since, and oh, no! it looks like the bass
drummer is having major balance problems; let&#146;s hope he can make it into formation,
and they&#146;re skating, skating, skating, skating, the band is skating around and around
<i><b>(variation: if we are in formation by this point, then say that we are standing,
standing, standing&#133;)</b></i>&#133;and yes! it looks like they&#146;re going to play a
song!</p>

and the Band wins another golden medal.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="clarkson"><big><big><strong><big>Ice Hockey - Brown vs.
Clarkson<br>
</big><em>February 27, 1998</em></strong></big></big></a></p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that French cuffs
its Cavariccis, it's the Brown University &quot;2 Legit to Quit&quot; Band!!!</p>

<p><strong>(Band hammers its way onto the ice)</strong></p>

<p>First was 70s nostalgia was chic, then 80s nostalgia was where it's at, but recent
events in the Persian Gulf have made the Band nostalgic for the early 90s. They were the
good old days...the good old days of the Bush administration. The Berlin Wall fell,
televangelist Jimmy Swaggart fell twice, and the Buffalo Bills fell four times. And oh,
how innocent and carefree we were! We all drank our Crystal Pepsi, as we dreamed of the
soulful voices of the New Kids on the Block. We also looked up to Milli Vanilli, but we
didn't want to be like them. We wanted to be musicians. In our quest to relive those happy
times, we've been scouring the thrift shops in search of Reebok Pumps and Hypercolor
T-shirts for that retro look. </p>

<p>Watch now as the band goes retro by forming a slap bracelet and playing &quot;Smells
Like Teen Spirit.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(Band forms a slap bracelet and plays &quot;Smells&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>Attention, Brown fans! Are YOU sitting in the hot seat? If you are, then GET UP! before
you get burned.</p>

<p><strong>(Pause)</strong></p>

<p>Last year, the Band traveled to Clarkson for a hockey game. The Band was deeply
offended by the rudeness of the Clarkson fans- where did they learn such behavior, from
sheep? We had wanted to take revenge by verbally abusing Clarskon in this week's show. But
then we realized that we didn't KNOW anything about Clarkson. It's so gosh darn obscure!
So instead, we decided to pay tribute to obscurity. We can name all our B vitamins- can
you? Did you know that the last Whig president of the US was Millard Fillmore? And we're
also world travelers: we've been to such exotic places as Ouagadougou and Djibouti! But
the Band's favorite road trip was to the nation of Andorra, tucked away in the picturesque
Pyrennes between France and Spain. We returned with a lovely photograph of the beautiful
Andorran landscape. All of it. Watch now as the Band salutes obscurity by forming Andorra
and playing &quot;Kodachrome.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(Band forms Andorra and plays &quot;Kodachrome&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>The Band recently completed its applications for the housing lottery and for BTV's new
show, The Dating Zone. But due to an unfortunate paperwork mix-up, we found ourselves in a
dating lottery (pause), with the following segments:</p>

<p>Segment I- Good Dates. (Pause.) These are probably already taken.<br>
Segment II- Special Interest Dates: ISO members, computer science concentrators, and Brown
Band show writers.<br>
Segment III- Sam Blackman.<br>
Segment IV- Your RC<br>
Segment V- singles, doubles, and triples<br>
Segment F- the Princeton Band</p>

<p>If you find yourself in Segment F, do not despair. There are still plenty of good dates
to be had, if you just do your research. </p>

<p><strong>(Pause.)</strong></p>

<p>As for the location of your date, may we suggest 18 and over night at the Underground.
We hear that it's very quiet and romantic. Watch now as the Band plays &quot;In the
Fray&quot; while presenting its entry in the lottery multimedia contest: a daring,
death-defying, date-winning B!</p>

<p><strong>(Band forms a counter-skate B while playing &quot;In the Fray.&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>We hope you enjoyed our shows for this year's hockey season. Be sure to join us next
year as the Brown Band takes on the football team.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="fanueil"><big><big><strong><big>Fanueil Hall Show<br>
</big><em>February 28, 1998</em></strong></big></big></a></p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting the organization that trashed the
U.S. Men's Hockey Team's hotel room, it's the Brown University &quot;Really, it was us.
For real. Really!&quot; Band!!</p>

<p>The Brown Band is a student-run musical organization that supports Brown athletic
teams. In addition to being Brown's athletic supporter, we play scripted halftime shows
for football games, and we are the only skating band in the world. Every year, we perform
two to three shows on the ice after hockey games. This show will be a sample of the Band's
musical and creative talent. Our first song will be &quot;For Bruno and For Brown.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(Band plays &quot;For Bruno and For Brown&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>In our shows, we generally parody many different things. For this show, we wanted to
make fun of staplers. Particularly maroon ones. But, we realized that the National
Association for the Preservation of Staplers (NAPS) might be offended. So we decided to
make fun of religion instead. Boy, isn't religion funny? Ha ha ha....(Scriptreader dies
dramatically, new scriptreader takes over.) Watch now as the Band salutes infinite cosmic
power by playing &quot;Starblazers.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(Band plays &quot;Starblazers&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>Aaarrrggghhhh, matees, ye be seein' a good show heeerrre, but can ye find me burried
treasurr? Heere be directions to me treasurr. Take I-95 North for three million seven
hundred 29 thousand paces, then take ye a left for fifteen thousan' four hundre' an' two
paces, then take ye a right a' the 7-11, an' it will be in the chest behin the garbage
cans. And ye' can have me bottle o' rum, too. Yo ho ho. Next, me matees from the Brown
Band will play &quot;Russian Sailors Dance.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(Band plays &quot;Russian Sailors Dance.&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>Speaking of Russian.... These two guys walk into a bar, and one of them is carrying an
octopus. He orders a beer and sets the octopus down on the bar. So, he's having his drink,
and the bartender comes up to him and says 'Excuse me, I can't help but notice you have an
octopus there. Why is that?' Just then, the octopus stands up and (scriptreader lapses
into Russian for a few sentences), and that's how they get the jelly in jelly donuts. And
this is how the Band sounds when they play &quot;Brown Cheering Song.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(Band plays &quot;Brown Cheering Song.&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>The Band recently had a marshmallow roast. Unfortunately, we ran out of regular
marshmallows and were forced to break open a limited edition box of Lucky Charms that the
Princeton Band sold us for sixty-nine cents. But after seeing the marshmallows, we
discovered just WHY the edition was so limited: Black anvils! Red hammer-and-sickles!
Green beans! And white teeth, to remind your child to visit the dentist IMMEDIATELY after
eating the cereal! (Short pause.) Our next song will be &quot;Joshua.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(Band plays &quot;Joshua&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>(Didactic, dry tone.) Now, before we continue any further with our show, I'd like to
pause so I can make a short discourse on the importance of revolution as a driving force
of social and cultural history. I will be focusing on the case studies of 1789 France and
1917 Russia, though not the case of the United States, as the popularly termed
&quot;American Revolution&quot; is something of a misnomer. Revolution involves an
overthrow of an existing social order, following the discontent of a critical mass of
people, who then are compelled to activism...(during this time, the Band has begun to eye
the scriptreader in a rather annoyed way, until he is approached from behind, suffocated
with a trench coat, and disposed of. New scriptreader takes over). Watch now as the Band
celebrates its revolutionary power by playing &quot;In the Fray&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>(Band plays &quot;In the Fray&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>The Brown Band has recently become interested in the study of language, and we did good
on our last grammar test, and we learned to not split infinitives, and we know what part
of the sentence to put our prepositions in, and we learned not to write really long run-on
sentences. But English isn't the only language we've been studying rigorously. In fact,
we're currently in training for the Hindi 500. And hey! We're not just proficient in human
languages--we can speak animal languages, too! To quote a well-known bear in his native
language: &quot;Only you can prevent forest fires.&quot; Watch now as the Band plays
&quot;Brown Bear.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(Band plays &quot;Brown Bear.&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>Now one thing the Brown Band occasionally does<br>
Is writing in verse, but only because<br>
Our humorous tendencies tend to erode<br>
(short pause) Not to mention, our President's car was just towed.</p>

<p>We write about politics, inkblots, and aliens,<br>
We're wordy, verbose, and sesquipedalian.<br>
And sometimes our scripts will include a surprise-<br>
At the end of this segment, the narrator dies.</p>

<p><strong>(Scriptreader looks up, confused. Has a knowing pissed-off-Kyle look on his
face. Is then hit over the head with a bass drum mallet. Dies unremarkably. New
scriptreader takes over.)</strong></p>

<p>Segue to haiku:<br>
Warped humor is essential.<br>
The Band plays &quot;Time Warp.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(Band plays &quot;Time Warp&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>And now, a final question for our audience to ponder: what is the sound of one band
clapping? (Band applauds) We hope you enjoyed the show, and join us tonight at 7:00, as
the Brown basketball team takes on Harvard, and the Band takes on the Harvard bass drum.</p>

<p>In this show, the Band would like to salute...er, we mean...completely ridicule the
college admissions process. For this purpose, our two brave show writers went to the
admissions office and said, &quot;Excuse me. We want to make fun of you. Can we have an
application?&quot; They told us they had run out, and to try back next September. After
being so quickly deferred by the admissions office, we set out in search of an
application, visiting 10 colleges in three days. We were unable to find an application
anywhere, so we decided to write our own and send it into Brown. We even filled out part
of it! Watch now as the Band plays &quot;Brown Application.&quot;</p>
