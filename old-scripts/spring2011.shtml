<h2>Dartmouth Hockey</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Ice Show!</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just hibernated for six weeks, it’s the Brown University “We literally ARE Brown Bears” BAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDD!
</p>
<p>Welcome back, one and all,. We’re sure you all missed us dearly while we were away, soaking up some sun. What else happened during the millennia we were away? Well, for starters, the roof of the Pitz—formally called the Pitzitola Sports Center Membrane Roof—collapsed in exactly the same fashion as the Metrodome. Then, because we were away for so long, global warming ended and the ice age restarted in a scenario not unlike The Day After Tomorrow. And just when we thought things couldn’t get more exciting, our men’s hockey team fulfilled a prophecy cast by a certain soccer player and literally “Beat the Yales 3-2.” What a productive break Brown had!
</p>
<p><i>Band forms Collapsed Pitz and plays Soul Man.

<p>While Brunonians were enjoying six blissful weeks of snow and slumber, our unlucky opponents, the Dartmouth Green Bay Packers, had to brave the frozen wasteland as they headed back to school for their winter trimester. Why would anyone want to go back to Dartmouth before April when the campus has finally melted and the polar bears living there have migrated back to the North Pole? Eight words, folks: The 100th Anniversary of the Dartmouth Winter KarnEvil. I know, right? Who WOULDN’T want to participate in fun activities such as the polar bear swim, snowshoe races, and cross-country-skiing-race-battle-Royale-Ninja-Warrior-challenge? What’s next, Dartmouth? Forcing your students to (drunkenly) act out scenes from popular video games, snow Goombas and all? That’s sick, Big Green. That’s just sick.
</p>
<p><i>Band forms Goomba and plays Ding Dong Song.
</i></p>
<p>Oh, right, stuff happened in the Real World while we were on break, too. The only newsworthy thing we could remember is fact that Bill Clinton will not be in The Hangover II. Such a disappointment! And now, a list of famous Dartmouth alumni who will also not be in The Hangover II: Meryl Streep.
</p>
<p><i>Band counterskates into a B and plays In The Fray.
</i></p>
<p>Phew, first ice show of the year completed! One down, one to go! Tune in on February 25 as our Men’s Hockey team takes on Cornell ‘s Big Red Carpet in celebration of the Academy Awards Ceremony taking place that weekend. Give our regards to Broadway, or should we say Hollywood? 
</p>
<p><i>#1/Bud off the ice?

<h2>Cornell Hockey</h2>
<div class="even"><h3>Ice Show!</h3>
<p>Jeff: Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants to train YOUR dragon, it's the Brown University "And the Oscar goes to…" BAAAANNNNNDDDDDDD!
</p><p>
Jeff: Welcome, one and all, to the Eighty-Third Annual Academy Awards Ceremony. As you can see, the Band is all decked out in their most resplendent attire as they walk (or skate) all over the BIG RED CARPET.
Other: Why yes, Jeff, and don't they look nice! And sorry for getting to the booth a bit late. Who's already gotten to the ceremony?
Jeff: Well, you missed Geoffrey Rush arriving in a giant egg, and apparently there was some sort of showdown between Jeff Bridges' three multiple personalities-the Dude versus Clu versus Rooster Cogburn!
Other: Woah, wish I could've seen that! But-wait, is that James Franco? Why is he missing one of his legs?
Jeff: I… couldn't tell you, to be honest. Oh, by the way, Colin Firth was quoted in an earlier interview as saying "I'm a thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles because I'm a thistle sifter."
Other: That's deep, man, that's deep. Roll Tide!</p>
<p>

<p>Jeff: Thank you, one and all, for attending our Academy Awards Ceremony…. Err, Second and Final Ice Show. We'd like to thank and bid a sweet farewell to our glorious Class of 2011-you guys rock and we love you very much.

<h2>Columbia Basketball</h2>
<div class="odd">

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni! Presenting an organization that thinks fall 2003 was a fantastic time to be alive, it's the Brown University "There's Nothing Wrong with Reusing and Recycling" BAAANNNNDDDDD!
</p>
<p>The great rivalries of our time: Cubs and White Sox. Don Zimmer and Pedro Martinez. Harvard and Yale. Everyone and Harvard. And now, Brown and Columbia. A Columbia student recently proposed that his school and ours, both without recognized rivals, come together and agree to, well, not come together. So, in true rivalry spirit, we'd like to start things off by saying... Columbia smells like Jersey. 
</p><p><i>Band forms Dollar Sign and plays "I Touch Myself."</i>
</p>
<p>Sorry to build you up and let your down, Columbia, but we don't think it will work out. Brown has too many rivals already: The MIFT, SUNY Globalization, Colonialism Community College, Brandeis... We're spread thinner than a chickenhawk's army after a unilateral strike. So let's just be friends. As a token of our good will, the band will go back a few minutes and pretend the first paragraph never happened.
</p>
<p><i>Band forms Deloriean and plays "The Time Warp"  colloquially known as HORSE WARP</i>
</p>
<p><i>*phone ringing noises</i>( "Hello? ... Oh, hi Mrs. C" Columbia, it's your mom. "Yeah, I can take a message. What? ... I can't say that. ... Mrs. C you shouldn't say that about. ... Mrs. C, I think you're trying to seduce me. ... Alright, alright. Thanks for the brownies, by the way. ... Okay, bye Mrs. C" Hey Columbia, your mom called, and she said ... "you do not meet her expectations for performance or effectiveness." 
</p>
