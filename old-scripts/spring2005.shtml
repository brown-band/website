      <em><small>Wednesday, January 19, 2005</small></em></a></h1>
	<p>Ladies and Gentleman, Alumni, and People Who are Just Friends, We Swear, presenting an organization that&#8217;s 86% effective when used correctly, it&#8217;s the Brown University &quot;Does my tongue taste funny to you?,&quot; BAND!</p>
	<p>The recent Valentine&#8217;s Day celebrations unearthed a lot of students who are unhappy with the dating situation at Brown. We believe we could improve the social scene by adding a disco ball in the Gate, having MTV pimp our SafeRide, and most importantly, by expanding Brown&#8217;s Cox Communications. We also hope that Bill Clinton&#8217;s impending arrival on campus will inspire others to help us with our trickle down policies. Until then, the Band will smoke its own cigars and play &quot;Beat It.&quot;</p>

	<p>Sick of being socially awkward, the Band polled the Brown community for its favorite pickup lines.</p>
A. I&#8217;m Dean Ripley, believe it or not.<br>
B. Want to see my Engine 90 Business plan?<br>
C. This Gap&#8217;s not closing any time soon<br>
D. I&#8217;m taking Magic in the Middle Ages, but did you put a spell on me?<br>
E. Want to go back to by place and watch the Russian Channel?<br>
F. The Clarkson Band<br>
	<p>The Band has now become the quicker picker upper, and for the most part, we&#8217;re much more absorbent than the leading brand. Having just stained Arnold Lounge&#8217;s floor, watch as we now tell our friend to hurry up and clean, playing &quot;Come on Eileen&quot;!</p>

	<p>We hope that when Clinton comes on campus, he&#8217;ll help us wipe up our Liquid Lounge situation as well revive other local businesses and making the Thayer St. economy go boing! First to open will be a pirate supply store for all of our local booty buccaneers. Not wanting to stop there, he&#8217;ll also help us petition to turn for a larger Ball park and make a guest appearance at a predominantly vegetarian Sarah Doyle Women&#8217;s Center event to help promote a more carnivorous lifestyle. If he takes any flack for his views, the Band will surely be on hand to help him out &quot;In the Fray.&quot;</p>

	<p>We&#8217;ll be celebrating our final ice show of the year, as well as Presidents&#8217; Day, by chopping down local cherry trees in order to begin construction on a new concert hall.</p>
