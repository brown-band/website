      to the web to continue our research into that mysterious institution.
      There we were able to learn a great deal about today's opposition. For
      example, we discovered that Easton was recently named the &quot;Most

      and has finally come to appreciate the finer things in life: 8:30 section,
      parking tickets, and the Ratty Cheese Baked Scrod. To quote the Brown Club
      of Chicago, &quot;Remember that shivery little 10-piece band we used to

      <p align="justify">Since the band is celebrating its 75th anniversary, we
      thought we'd teach the band all about its history. So here's a simple
      question: &quot;Little band, who made thee; dost thou know who made
      thee?&quot;</p>

      one point possessed New England's largest bass drum, an honor that now
      rests with Harvard. According to a 1925 Brown Daily Herald Article &quot;A
      corps of drummers, a first string and an assistant drummer, practiced all
      summer and developed what was considered the smoothest bass drum technique
      this side of the Jordan.&quot; The band will now use its oversize bass

      introduce Mr Warren Leonard, class of 1930 the band's first student
      conductor. Mr Leonard will now lead the band in playing a number from its

      <p align="justify">Unlike Mr. Leonard, some things just shouldn't be
      brought back. The band would like to salute all the things from the 70's
      that ought to be left alone, like disco night at the Ratty, &quot;that
      seventies show&quot;, and Sister Sledge. Watch now as the band shows its

      <p align="justify">We asked Decartes to help us out with this script - he
      said &quot;I think not&quot; and disappeared in a poof of smoke. Watch now
      as the band forms a puff of smoke that looks suspiciously like a football,
      and plays a Mozart sonata that sounds suspiciously like
      &quot;Championship.&quot;</p>

      <p align="justify">As you can see (or rather hear) the band is in a
      constant state of denial. And we don't mean Egypt. Speaking of bodies of
      water, if when you go into the bathroom you're Russian, when you come out
      of the bathroom you're American, what are you when you're in the bathroom?
      (pause) European! (band groans.) Watch as the band forms B for Brown and
      cheers the team along.</p>

      <p align="justify">We just flew in from Providence, and boy are our arms
      tired. Speaking of flying, what has four wheels and flies? A garbage
      truck! Speaking of garbage, how about that Penn Band? The Penn band could
      be the farmer's best friend - just spread them over the fields and watch
      the corn spring up! Watch now as the band makes hay while the sun shines
      and plays &quot;Evil Maize.&quot;</p>

      <p align="justify">The beauty of rural Pennsylvania brings to mind the
      line from &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; about amber waves of grain.
      But not all of Pennsylvania is an Amish paradise; much of it is a
      trailer-park heaven. Which begs the question, &quot;Why did the Band cross
      I-95? To get to the double-wide.&quot; Watch now as the band forms a
      twister and demolishes the Pennsylvania countryside.</p>

      Looks like the brown band is somewhere over the rainbow! Well, there
      doesn't seem to be anything interesting here. We'd better just go back
      into our closet (or a bus) and go home. Watch now as the brown band clicks
      its combat boots together three times and rides back home on another
      tornado.</p>

      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization
      that's colder than it's ever been (and now it's even colder), it's the
      Brown University, &quot;What's this flaky white stuff?&quot; Band!</p>
      <p>According to the laws of chaos theory, every snowflake is unique in its
      own, special way. The band is good at being chaotic. If a butterfly flaps
      its wings in Taiwan, we end up flat on our backs in Providence. Watch now
      as the band becomes something you've never seen before, or will ever see
      again...</p>

      <p>You may be wondering... what would the future be like right now if we
      had formed a sheep instead? There's a well known parable about a person -
      let's say a Brown student - who discovers a time machine. She uses it to
      go back to the days of the dinosaurs, with strict instructions not to
      alter anything in any way. She slips, however, and squashes something -
      say a prehistoric sheep. When she returns to her own time, she discovers
      that her world is completely changed. The U.S. is a monarchy, apples are
      oranges... and she goes to Dartmouth! Watch now as the band forms a
      prehistoric sheep, and plays &quot;Stargrazers.&quot;</p>
      <p><b>[Band makes a sheep, plays &quot;Stargrazers&quot;]</b></p>
      <p>Too bad there's no snow [or if there's snow, say &quot;Good thing
      there's snow&quot;]. We could have demonstrated our favorite chaotic
      principle - the Snowball Effect. No, not &quot;snowballing,&quot; you
      warped people. We're referring to iterations -something that starts small
      and grows and grows and grows more complicated. Like the Brown football
      team's defensive strategy. If you're still not sure what we mean, we'll
      show you.</p>
      <p><b>[Band plays No. 4, starts in a clump and chaotically forms a B]</b></p>
      <p>Thanks for coming all the way to Hanover - we know it's quite an
      ordeal. We'd be honored if you joined us in sunny, warm, technologically
      enhanced Providence for the last game of the season against Columbia.</p>

      <p align="justify">Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an
      organization whose favorite smurf was Handy Smurf, it's the Brown
      University, &quot;La la la-la la la&quot; ... BAND!</p>
      <p align="justify">The band spent the past week writing, directing, and
      producing its own musical: &quot;The Life and Times of Josiah Carberry.&quot;
      Wanting a frenetic, high-energy show, the band tried to recruit Tommy Tune
      as its choreographer. Unfortunately we had to make due with Professor
      Morone. We had to give up our dream of opening at the Winter Garden for a
      slightly smaller space... a broom closet on fifth floor Keeney. Watch now
      as the band looks for another opening, and gets off off off off off
      Broadway.</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>[</b><b>Band forms star, plays &quot;On
      Broadway&quot;]</b></p>
      <p align="justify">Our protagonist is a young doctor of psychoceramics who
      comes of age in New York during the era of blackjack and Madame Butterfly.
      Wait-- forget the blackjack. And New York City. We'll just call it
      &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; and set it in Japan, with Godzilla as the
      love interest. Mothra will appear in a special role as the spurned lover.
      Watch now as the show's one star rating goes up in flames, and the band
      plays &quot;Starblazers.&quot;</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>[</b><b>Band forms butterfly, plays &quot;Starblazers&quot;]</b></p>
      <p align="justify">Tragically, our hero is killed when Mothra asks him if
      he is a god, and he says no. The correct answer, of course, is &quot;You
      bet your sweet patootie I'm a god.&quot; Mothra then goes to a final
      battle with the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man over the streets of Kyoto. Watch
      now as the band forms B for butterfly and covers the field with sweet,
      sticky white stuff.</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>[</b><b>Band forms B, plays &quot;In the Fray&quot;]</b></p>
      <p align="justify">We feel that Mothra, like the Columbia Band, was just
      misunderstood. All it asked for was a little tender loving care. Speaking
      of TLC, next week the band will be taking a holiday to go home and eat so
      much they'll have to roll us back up College Hill. Happy Thanksgiving,
      everyone!</td>
