<h2>Georgetown</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that.s been on both sides of the benedict it.s the Brown University .Holy Water Batman. Band!!</p>
<p><em>Band runs onto field</em></p>
<p>The Brown Band is so very excited that Georgetown has graced us with their presence that we are can barely stop our instruments from leaking. Last time we came to Georgetown, you guys blessed the field, and because at Brown we pride ourselves sharing the experience, we decided to do the same. But since we have no official religious affiliation watch now as the band ushers our very own spiritual figure onto the field and plays a hymn, wholely.</p>
<p><em>Band Forms Death Star, plays Imperial March</em></p>
<p>Now that the field has been made palpatinely holy, the band will B-labor the point play in the pray.</p>
<p><em>Band Forms B and plays In the Fray.</em></p></div>
<div class="even"><h3>Half Time</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni Presenting an Organization that always runs trots and skis! It.s the Brown University .why is there red in my Brown!?. Band!</p>
<p>So many changes have occurred at Brown this semester. They.ve added 69 cents to the meal price and have given us 5 more dollars to wrap our Paws around. With all this money flowing back to the students, the Brown Band has managed to buy out Brown and has now deemed campus as fully communist. So Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, welcome to RED university (Band takes off jackets). As our first order of business, the RED Band will celebrate this glorious occasion by making a tribute to Sean Connery, and going a Hunt for Red September.</p>
<p><em>Band form a Tribute and plays September.</em></p>
<p>There are going to be some serious changes going on now that Red is the new Brown. Vice-President of Communism is Dean Mao Zedong. Dean of Women Advancement is Ms. Ho Chi Minh. And in charge of Campus Initiatives of Today is a guy named John, who told us he.ll present his set of initiatives tomorrow.*cough*.but until then that we should make a monument for our beloved President, Ruth the Red, and play .You Can Call Me Jake..</p>
<p><em>Band forms biological sign for female and plays You Can Call me Al</em></p>
<p>Ruefully, due to a lack of work ethic and some indelible corruptness that comes from residing in Rhody, the Band has been forced to sell Red back to Brown. Although saddened by the loss of our grand nation, the artists-formerly-known as Red are always ready to Brown themselves again. Watch now as the Band waggles its instruments ebulliently at masses, forms a B, and welcomes Brown Forevermore.</p>
<p><em>band forms B and plays #3</em></p>
<p>Join us Next week when Brown welcomes Harvard.with a vengeance!</p>
<p><em>Band Marches off to #1</em></p></div>

<h2>Harvard</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pre-Game</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that will never stop coming early, It.s the Brown University .Roshashanna, Roshashanna, Oy Vey Vey, Lech Heim!. Band!</p>
<p><em>Band runs on to field</em></p>
<p>The Brown Band was so happy to hear that Harvard was saving the bacon of poorer students everywhere by ending early admission. Your actions and initiatives in the matter have even given Princeton the impetus to address its own early admission predicament. That takes chutzpah, and we admire that. By removing the silver spoon of privilege from the bowels of sordid legacy, you have taken the measures required to stick it to the man, or woman. To commemorate this glorious day, the Brown Band will form a symbolic spoon and play Hold On .Til Spring, I.m Coming.</p>
<p><em>Band Forms Spoon and plays Hold On I.m Coming</em></p>
<p>Although we applaud you Harvard for you coming to sensibilities and trying to do the right thing, but realistically you guys have just given prospective high school seniors, one more reason to Brown themselves. So watch now as we represent those high school seniors, make a symbolic B-line to the Van Wickle gates, and proclaim our status as Brown Men Born.</p>
<p><em>Band forms B and makes Brown Man Born</em></p></div>
<div class="even"><h3>Half Time</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an Organization that not Ruthless, it.s the Brown University .Ruth gets to stay, You get a Chinese vegetable!. Band!</p>
<p><em>Band Runs onto field</em></p>
<p>The Brown Band is concerned about the state of the world at the moment. Up is down, left is right, black is white.Pluto isn.t a planet. We feel cheated and lied to. In fact, we realize that this removal our beloved Pluto as a planet is only one example of a plethora of facts turned false. Segways were supposed to be the end of walking, but we still have to use our legs like chumps.  Fresh Spinach was supposed to be good for you, now it.s bringer of violent dysentery. The Boogie Man was supposed to be false, but now we find out he.s currently making Jamaican dance hall records. Watch now as the Brown Band mentally grasps these revelations, forms a specter it hardly knows, and proves it.s not afraid of the boogie man or any ghosts.</p>
<p><em>Band Forms Ghost and Plays Ghostbusters</em></p>
<p>The Brown Band has just compiled a list of things once true, but are now defunct just to prove to how full of lies this world is. And here.s the list:</p>
<p>A)The Link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda.Unless it.s an unannounced Legend of Zelda video game title.</p>
<p>B)That Ronald Reagan tore down the Berlin Wall..we found out wrecking balls were used.</p>
<p>C)Social Security. If you aren.t getting it now, you won.t ever.</p>
<p>D)That The Cookie Monster eats cookies. C is NOT For cookies but for carrots, and that is NOT good enough for me.</p>
<p>E)The Brontosaurus. How can something go extinct twice? Apatosaurus on the head for whoever was in charge of that one.</p>
<p>F)THE PRINCETON BAND!!!</p>
<p>Well.the last one isn.t defunct, and hopefully it never will be (semper fi Stanford Band), but Watch now as the band forms a time machine, and goes back in time to pay tribute to when all these things were true .or not.</p>
<p><em>Band Forms Time Machine and plays Time Warp</em></p>

<p>As we finally come to terms with all this, we can.t help but realize some things never change...like Harvard.s sub-parness. Wait, what this? Apparently a group of scientists have gotten together and decide Harvard is now a dwarf university because it is too cold and distant. Tough luck for the Crimson, but its ok. you.ll still always the Michigan of the East. Watch now as the band forms a B cough for Harvard.s new flushometers and plays #2.</p>

<p><em>Band Forms a B and plays #2</em></p>

<p>Join us next week when Bruno battles the Ram and shouts .It.s either U! R I!. </p></div>

<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentleman, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an Organization that has a history with Chaffey, Lincoln, is the Brown University .Hurras today, gone tomorrow?. Band!</p>

<p>The Brown Band is exhausted from its 69-minute pilgrimage across the expansive state of Rhode Island, but is all a jitter to see the supple Cup of the Governor. If you play your game right, URI, this year could be your chance to get lucky, as we all know URI hasn.t Rammed its way to a scoring and winning season since 2001. Now this might be because of your cough conservative endowment or it could be because URI sounds like UTI... But in any case, we love you rhody.lose or lose, rain or.rain.  So watch now as we represent our love for you, form a heart and play From Me to U.RI.</p>

<p><em>Band forms heart and Plays From Me to You</em></p>

<p>Now that we.ve shared our feelings and everything is out in the open we are going take a break. Watch as the Brown Band trombone section shines its rusty instruments for the game while the band forms a B for Bumming around, and plays .Brown? There!.</p>

<p>The Brown Band noticed that URI was holding Speak-Easy Jeopardy today from 2-6pm, and being the helpful and sincere organization that we are, decided to help facilitate the matter. But before we do, let us just say we very proud of U..RI for taking measures to lubricate its obviously desiccated campus. With less friction, we are sure coming and goings of campus will be going much Smoother . To represent this, watch now as the Band forms a symbolic greased wheel and plays Smooth.</p>

<p><em>Band Forms Wheel and plays Smooth</em></p>

<p>Ok now Back to Speak-Easy Jeopardy. The Band has been busy thinking of categories to wet the whistles of those participating. And here they are:</p>

<p><em>Band forms ice cream and plays Stacey.s mom</em></p>

<p>Well its time to us to go Rhody, no no It.s not you, its URI. Be strong guys as you are a mighty institution. In fact, some may even call you the Harvard of nowhere. So as we bow out, The band will grab some Craisins from .The Butt. Refectory, form a B for Benevolence, and play Thanks 4 sharing.</p>

<p><em>Band Forms a B and plays # 4.</em></p>

<p>Next week the Bruno will face Holy Cross, and although the band won.t physically be there, our spirit will surely cross the line.</p>

<p>The Brown Band has got your number Princeton. The signs of your insecurity are so obvious. Your blatant correction of your early admission problem right after Harvard.s.the inflation of your ehem Egos by denying grade inflation.the investment in a super computing instrument with an enormous hard drive.
