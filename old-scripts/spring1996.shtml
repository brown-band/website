<h1 align="center"><a name="colgate">Ice Hockey - Brown vs. Colgate<br>
<small><em>Friday, February 16, 1996</em></small></a></h1>

<p><strong>[Band assembles at edge of arena] </strong></p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, presenting an organization that promises not
to make any toothpaste jokes, it's the Brown University &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot; Band. </p>

<p><strong>[Band gracefully skates onto ice... hopefully] </strong></p>

<p>The band would like to wish you all a belated happy Valentine's Day. Yeah... it was
last Wednesday in case you just didn't notice. Did you get any chocolates? All I got was a
rock. </p>

<p>While Valentine's Day may be for the average Brown student what Labor Day is for the
unemployed, at least it gives us a chance to find out just how much the Undergraduate
Council of Students cares for us all. Why just look at their HUGS project, hitting us over
the head with the fact that Brown students can't socialize without government
interference. And as if that weren't nice enough of them, Time Magazine did a story on the
project so now the entire country is convinced we're losers. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms heart, plays &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>The final insult came in the form of a form-- a computer dating form, that is. Of
course, we all know that everybody just filled it out for a laugh. And of course anybody
who buys a list is only doing it because he or she knows the money is going to financial
aid. </p>

<p>The band did notice that the form was sadly deficient in its options, so we would like
to present our revised version: Question #1. If you were a car, what would you be? <br>
A) A Hummer <br>
B) An Edsel <br>
C) A Jalopy <br>
D) A Lime-green Chevy Impala </p>

<p>2. What is the facial feature you notice first on the opposite sex? <br>
A) Eyes <br>
B) Smile <br>
C) Nostril hair </p>

<p>3. How important are clothes and appearance? <br>
A) Unimportant. What counts is personality, which is completely separate from these things.
<br>
B) Gimme a break. Read your Kierkegaard! Appearance and clothing are manifestations of
style. A person's personality will inevitably change over time, but constancy of style
avoids discontinuities in the temporal progression of the self. <br>
C) Clothes and appearance deal with a being's projection onto the plane of reality, and
thus are linked to matters of finitude. Personality, on the other hand, exists on the
plane of the transcendent. Both are key elements, and to deny the importance of either is
to indulge in what Jean-Paul Sartre called &quot;Bad Faith.&quot; </p>

<p>Watch now as the band forms existential angst and plays &quot;Epistemology
Forevermore.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms blob and plays &quot;Brown Forevermore&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Question #4. When you're walking down the street, do you smile at people? <br>
A) Yes <br>
B) Only if I know them <br>
C) No <br>
D) I glare at them malevolently due to my misanthropic nature </p>

<p>5. Your feelings toward pets are: <br>
A) Love pets; would like at least two <br>
B) Like pets; one is enough <br>
C) No thanks; I'm a vegetarian </p>

<p>6. If you had a chance to have your fortune told for free, what would you do? <br>
A) Decline because you think it's nonsense <br>
B) Accept but not take it seriously <br>
C) Accept and heed the fortune teller's words <br>
D) Suspect that it's part of a government conspiracy, but I'm not gonna fall for it!
They're after my lucky charms aren't they? NO! THEY'RE MAGICALLY DELICIOUS AND THEY'RE ALL
MINE! Pink hearts! Yellow moons! Orange stars! Green clovers! Blue Diamonds! </p>

<p><strong>[Band yells &quot;And purple horseshoes!&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Forms should be deposited under the door of Fulton rehearsal hall. All answers will be
kept confidential as long as your check doesn't bounce. Here's to good luck in finding
love through technology, and even if you don't trust computers you can just call up the
two people listed as your least compatible. Maybe by next Valentine's Day you'll be
singing along with the band. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms obligatory &quot;B,&quot; plays &quot;I Got You (I Feel
Good)&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>Join us next Friday when Brown hockey takes on Saint Lawrence and the band attempts a
triple axle. </p>

<p><strong>[Band takes a bow, then skates away playing #1] </strong></p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="clarkson">Ice Hockey - Brown vs. Clarkson<br>
<small><em>Saturday, Feburary 24, 1996</em></small></a></h1>

<p><strong>[Band gathers at edge of ice and shivers in anticipation, or maybe it's just
the cold] </strong></p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has been
shown to cause hypochondria in lab rats, it's the Brown University &quot;nighttime
sniffling sneezing coughing aching stuffy head fever so you can rest&quot; Band! </p>

<p><strong>[Band storms rink] </strong></p>

<p>Guess what boys and girls? It's housing lottery time again! As a public service the
band would like to answer the ten questions most frequently asked about the housing
lottery: </p>

<p>#10)Is the Grad Center really bad as everyone says? <br>
#9)If I live in Social Dorm does that mean I have to join the ISO? <br>
#8)Is housing lottery anything like that short story &quot;The Lottery&quot; where they
pick someone's name out of a hat and throw stones at them? <br>
#7)Is the Brown Band show writer single? <br>
#6)Isn't squatting illegal in Rhode Island? <br>
#5)If I live in a Greek House does that mean I have to speak Greek? <br>
#4)If my number is bad enough will I end up in a janitor's closet? <br>
#3)Are janitor's closets networked? <br>
#2)Is the Grad Center really all that bad? <br>
#1)I'm a CS major, I live in the CIT, can I just skip this housing lottery thing? </p>

<p>And the answers, in no particular order, are: </p>

<p>I remember that story, I read it in sixth grade <br>
No, but you get free toilet paper <br>
Yes <br>
No way <br>
Really! It was designed by the same guy who did the Providence Jail <br>
No, but it is in South Carolina <br>
Maybe <br>
No, but you might end up living in the basement of the Ratty <br>
You must be joking! <br>
And, Yes, funny you should ask, he is available. His phone number is 863-- What? I'm just
reading what it says in the script here. OK, OK... </p>

<p>Watch now as the band forms the most important element of the housing lottery -- pure
luck -- and plays &quot;Everybody Needs Somewhere to Live&quot; </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms pure luck (an arch, which decays into a quantum electron cloud of
God playing dice with swirling bandies) and plays &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody&quot;
(Familiar? Naaah, this is NOTHING like last week's show!)] </strong></p>

<p>Elrod and his friends -- who just happen to be named after characters from really bad
eighties sit-coms -- are rising juniors eager to get out of the Graduate Center. They
enter the segment one lottery as a group, hoping to get a Young O. Apartment.
Unfortunately, they soon realize that their numbers aren't good enough to get them a
storage closet in the basement. Instead, they decide to go for a New Dorm suite. </p>

<p>Even though their copies of Grapevine don't arrive until two weeks after the lottery,
they realize the importance of getting there on time and decide to go for coffee. Elrod
and Balki want to go to Starbucks, but Booger -- the janitor from Good Times -- wants Au
Bon Pain, and Schneider -- the janitor from One Day At A Time -- prefers Cafe la France.
Arguing over where to get coffee, they lose track of time and miss their turn. Instead,
all those people who live in Herman's head get their suite. Oh, the irony! If only they'd
gone to Ocean for Depth-Charges they wouldn't be living in a hole in the ground in the
middle of Wriston. </p>

<p>Watch now as the band performs its salute to the Depth-Charge. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms snazzy rotating X and plays &quot;Brown Forevermore&quot; at triple
tempo (Familiar? OK, same songs... but we got different shapes this time!)] </strong></p>

<p>Lady and gentleman, friend and alumnus, presenting an organism that has seen snow and
hyperspace in lap dogs, it's the clown universally &quot;if you don't look good, we don't
care&quot; bland! </p>

<p>Faded equilibrium, fiends and apple pie, resenting disorganization fat green glow
lipstick traces fab cats, it's the get down eventually &quot;nothing short of a
miracle&quot; hand! </p>

<p>Psychobabble, technobabble, trendybabble, A-yoo, A-vee, A-doubleyoo, Annex,
X-chromosome, ex post facto, expatriate, tourniquet, survival kit, kit, baby fox, bagel
with lox, picking locks, pickle socks. . . </p>

<p><strong>[Announcer taps microphone] </strong></p>

<p>Excuse me, it seems we were having microphone problems again. Watch now as the band
stretches the limits of its first amendment rights in protest of the Communications
Decency Act and shouts fire in a crowded auditorium. </p>

<p><strong>[Band forms &quot;B&quot; (surprise!) and plays &quot;Fire&quot;] </strong></p>

<p>We hope you've enjoyed our little play. Be on the lookout for more fun and educational
special events with the Brown Band this Spring. </p>

<p><strong>[Band takes its final bow, then skates off to #1] </strong></p>
