<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>Brown vs. U.R.I<br>
September 27, 1975&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough of these 
RAM-ifications, Ladies, and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni and all you sheepish 
grins, presenting the only band who’s hairdresser doesn’t even know for sure, 
straight from a quick engagement in the U.R.I. locker room, it’s the Pembroke 
College bump and grind Band.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Band runs from 
trees into block formation, plays a few measures of “Ain’t She Sweet,” cadence 
into “Our Director’s March,” replete with pinwheels, high stepping and the whole 
shtick)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Band would 
like to acquaint the returning student body with some of the current events the BDJ has been unable to cover due to lack of funds.&nbsp; The dearth of money has 
resulted in a shortage of such essential items as resident fellows, toilet 
paper, and junior faculty members.&nbsp; In fact, there seems to be a shortage of 
just about everything except- Freshmen.&nbsp; With 1,335 in the class of 79—971.5 of 
whom are Pre-Meds, the Band would like to be the first to misspell the N.Y. 
Times rumor that the nationwide class of 79 is D-U-M-B but they are “Coming In 
On A Wing and A Prayer.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(D M U B- formed during the words misspells the rumor.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the 
university’s fiscal floundering, veteran Brunonians have noticed that there’s 
something fishy going on.&nbsp; Project Build a Better Brown By Bringing Back Beauty 
to Camp Bruno has included such noticeable achievements as the laying of a new 
sidewalk of the green, grass in Wriston Quad, the Pembroke sculpture that makes 
even the new dorms look good, Whitehall is now a garage, and Lloyd’s is now a 
parking lot.&nbsp; In memory of this, demolished delectable delicatessen the band 
forms the intersection of Brook and Waterman and plays “Standing On the Corner.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>And this hot 
flash from the Housing Office</u> – the 145 transfer students who have been 
living in Arnold Lounge have been reassigned off-campus housing.&nbsp; The Band 
extends its sympathies to these homeless waifs and plays.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Repeat 
“Standing On the Corner.”&nbsp; Run out of previous formation and then run back into 
on whistle).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be back in two 
weeks to see the real dogs from New Haven Tech.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Brown vs. Penn<br>
October 4, 1975</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left; text-indent: .5in">
&nbsp;Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and Alumni, and all you Milton Bradley dropouts, 
presenting the phoniest band that funny money can buy, straight from a two-week 
engagement monopolizing the streets of Atlantic City, New Jersey, it’s the Brown 
University all-purpose utility band.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&nbsp; (Come running out into two 
dice)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Philadelphia being the 
Bicentennial capital, the band pays tribute to a great invention of 1776: 
Monopoly.&nbsp; To get the show rolling the band throws a three the hard way and 
promptly moves to Boardwalk.&nbsp; Since we cheat, all we need now is a little bit of 
luck.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;(Play “With a Little Bit of 
Luck.”)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;This is the city, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania.&nbsp; We were working the day shift out of fraud and bunko.&nbsp; We got a 
call from the Brown Band.&nbsp; They said that they had landed on Community Chest, 
but somebody had already grabbed it.&nbsp; Sounded like the work of the Rank Schizzo 
Gang (Dum-De-Dum-Dum)&nbsp; 2:29 P.M.&nbsp; Suspect was apprehended at the site of his 
newly erected house.&nbsp; Suspect was convicted and sentenced as following: Go 
directly to jail, do not pass the buck, do not collect kickbacks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">(Finish playing Dragnet forming 
jail bars.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The band passes Go twice, collects 
$400, and lands on Chance, but since we never take chances we roll again.&nbsp; With 
our newly acquired wealth we consider investing in the nearest utility.&nbsp; We 
would buy the Trenton Water Works but we’re not sure that they do.&nbsp; The band 
forms a big drip on the field and plays Drip Drops Keep Falling on My Head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">(Play Raindrops and form drop 
coming out of faucet)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Getting board with the game, the 
band salutes its former athletic director, Andy Geiger.&nbsp; Andy was offered a 
house on Pennsylvania Avenue and thinking that it was Penn State he accepted.&nbsp; 
Unable to form a Nittany Lion on the field the Band instead salutes our former 
athletic director Ferdinand Andy Geiger by forming his initials on the field and 
playing king Andy’s Song.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">(Play “King Herd’s Song” forming 
F-A-G)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Be back two years from now when 
the band finds out if Penn is still in the Ivy League.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">(Off to “In The Fray”)</p>
<p align="center"><b>Brown vs. Yale<br>
October 11, 1975 </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and 
Alumni, and all you freshmen mothers and fathers, and their parents. &nbsp;Presenting 
the one band only a mother could love, smuggled in especially for today’s 
performance from lovely, downtown Hohokus, New Jersey.&nbsp; It’s the Brown 
University Marching Contra-band.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">(Run out into a phone)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The band would like to continue 
its series of lectures on things you should know about Brown entitled, Barely 
Facts.&nbsp; Ringing in the Centrex system’s first anniversary the band offers 
instruction on fun things you can do with your phone.&nbsp; Ever try dialing 3-0-3-3?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">(Numbers on phone dial out the 
number, saxes play a busy signal)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Rug out from dialing the housing 
office for half the day, the band invests a few dollars, get s a touchtone 
phone. (form touchtone phone) and attempts to buzz President Hornig’s office.&nbsp; 
(triangles for phone ringing)&nbsp; We’re sorry, but this number is no longer in 
service.&nbsp; Desperate to hear a human voice at 3 AM the band finds out what it 
missed for dinner by dialing M-E-N-U.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">(Push buttons dial number; 
recording of Ratty meal.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">In response to this repulsive 
Ratty repast, the band plays “Classical Gas”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">(Whistle into approx. F.A.G.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Speaking of loose connections, the 
band wires the athletic department person to person to Mr. Ferdinand Andy Geiger 
only to find he’s no longer with us.&nbsp; It seems someone made Andy an offer to 
come to Pennsylvania and thinking that it was Penn State, he didn’t refuse.&nbsp; 
With Geiger’s resignation the athletic department decided to cut back from a 
three letterman to a two letterman by appointing Bob Seiple.&nbsp; The band salutes 
its new censure and plays shut up the band.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">(play “Strike Up the Band” and run 
into B.S.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Digressing momentarily from the 
mainstream of this afternoon’s symposium, the band tacitly turns from initials 
to officials and takes a primary look at the upcoming nominations for Camp 
Bruno’s new director by compiling a catalogue of compulsory credentials.&nbsp; He or 
she must possess:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -18.75pt; margin-left: 90.75pt">A)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The openness and candor of Ron Zeigler</p>

</span>The ability to leap the Sci Li in a single bound.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">The band salutes our future 
commandant, forms his office in University Hall, and plays “Beginnings”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">Be back one year from now to see 
if the Yale band has finally been house broken</p>
