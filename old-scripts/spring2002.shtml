Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization <br>
that isn't afraid to go down head first, it's the Brown University <br>
&quot;this luge is slippery when wet&quot; BAND!!!<br>
<br>
It's Olympic season again, time for joy, time for tears, and time for <br>
Canada to achieve fleeting relevance to the rest of the world. After <br>
the warm reception of skeleton to this year's games, Olympic officials <br>
contracted with the Fox network to add even more exciting new sports to <br>
the next Winter Olympics. Look for Temptation Pairs Figure Skating, The <br>
Chamber luge, Speed Skating away from the stars of When Good Pets Go <br>
Bad 3, college liberals ironically watching The O'Reilly Factor (on <br>
ice), and Throwing Snowballs at the executive who canceled Family Guy. <br>
Watch now as the band waits for the adoption of vegan brown ice pilaf <br>
as a sport and forms its current favorite Olympic &quot;Vehicle,&quot; the <br>
bobsled.<br>
<br>

<br>
That's all well and good, but it's hard to enjoy the Olympics when <br>
people are getting mugged at knife point in their very dorm rooms. To <br>
combat the rising crime spree, police and security are considering <br>
building a BUPS signal on top of the sci-li, posting snipers on grad <br>
center, and training Mark Perry to use his latent telekinetic powers. <br>
These solutions will of course do nothing against the real cause of <br>
crime on campus, demons summoned by the paranormal resonance from the <br>
newly-constructed Thomas Watson Center for International Studies. Watch <br>
now as the band swallows the bitter pill that the Tee-Watt is the root <br>
of all campus evil and plays &quot;Think.&quot;<br>
<br>
[band forms a stick figure]<br>
<br>
Even though there haven't been any Crime Reports in the past few days, <br>
we're pretty certain that the Tee-Watt is just being abstinent for <br>
Lent. But what can be done to stem the rising tide of Hell that will be <br>
coming inside the walls of this building? First and foremost, don't buy <br>
anything from the Hourglass Café, because while it seems that you're <br>
just hurting yourself, that money actually goes straight to the 7th <br>
circle to fund the construction of more slanting-out windows. Secondly, <br>
wear some sort of full-body protection when you go inside the Tee-Watt <br>
to keep you safe from anything lurking in the darkness. Finally, it has <br>
been prophesied that the only way to truly subdue the Tee-Watt is to <br>
hook it up with sci-li's 14 stories of power, strength, and virtue. <br>
Even though this process will cause activation of Tee-Watt's fire <br>
sprinklers and subsequent uncontrollable flooding, that is the price <br>
that must be paid for safety on campus. Watch now as the band, free <br>
from the Tee-<br>
Watt's evil clutches, can practice for its entry in the next Winter <br>
Olympics, the legendary, unsurpassed, take-that-Scott-Hamilton <br>
COUNTERSKATE!!!<br>

Thank you for coming to the Band's Final Skating Show of the Season. <br>
Stop by next semester for football, when the Band will answer the age <br>
old question, &quot;which is funnier, a chimpanzee on a trampoline or former <br>
president Warren G. Harding?&quot;<br>
