<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an
organization that got rid of its last cello player just six months ago, it&#146;s the

</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, ladies and gentlemen, we&#146;ve learned that President Clinton
recently visited Brown Stadium, and now we&#146;d like to ask all you Brown fans: are <i>you</i>
sitting in the hot seat? While you contemplate that, watch now as the Band forms its
favorite type of letter and plays Indecent Relationships Forevermore.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Ladies and gentlemen, presenting an organization that is
under the care of the Federal Witness Protection program, it's the Yale &quot;Under Lock
and Key&quot; Precision Marching Band!</font></p><font size="3">
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Band skulks onto field.)</p></b>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With all of the terrorist bombings of late, the organization formerly
known as the Brown Band, which formed an exploding BMW in one of its previous shows,
decided it would be wise to go undercover by taking on an alternate identity...</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To do this, we had to send a member of the Band on a secret mission to
New Haven. <i><b>(007 voice.)</b> </i>Her name was Band. <i><b>(Pause.) </b></i>Jane Band.
<i><b>(Mock-dramatic, mystery novel narration.) </b></i>To prepare for the infiltration,
she donned a navy blazer, dumped some extra starch into her underwear, and kissed her
lover goodbye - because after all, she was going to New Haven and was not sure if she'd
ever return.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Being the well-funded bandie she was, she stowed herself away in the
UHaul of a returning Yale student. Deciding to start her research into the life of a real
Yalie, she started to rummage through the suspicious-looking paraphernalia in search of
band contraband. However, among the wardrobe of varying shades of dark navy blue blazers
(all embroidered with the insignias of various secret societies), she found only one thing
that might distinguish this person as a Yale bandie: an LP which contained nothing but bad
70s music. Watch now as the &quot;Yale&quot; Band forms a record and plays &quot;Bulldog
Inferno.&quot;</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Band forms record, rotates, and plays &quot;Disco Inferno.&quot;)</p></b></i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As she listened to the record with dread in her heart, socks in her
shoes and that darn starch in her underwear, she began to chafe. After applying the
crunchy cheese-baked scrod to soothe her sensitive skin, the U-Haul creaked to a stop. Man,
that transition stunk, she said to herself. So she went to check the transition fluid.
Failing to see a problem, mostly because of the New Haven smog, she continued on in her
story.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wearing her navy blazer, effectively disguising her true identity, she
was immediately swept up into world of the Yale Underground. She entered the Vault,
swiftly confronted by the KGB- the Killer Gumby Band. She was taught the ways of the KGB
and by quirk of fate sent back to probe the <i><b>(loaded pause)</b></i> minds of the
Brown Band Think Tank, to find out just what their mysterious buttons meant.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The KGB, however, used something a bit more devious then a
U-Haul to
send her on her way - they unveiled their top secret ICBM - an intercollegiate ballistic
missile, complete with passenger-side airbag and antilock brakes. Watch now as the Yale
Band forms an ICBM and sends off Jane from Yale, with love, as she is headed For Bruno and
For Brown. </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Band forms ICBM, plays #4)</p></b></i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We thank Jane for joining us today -- she just landed in time to inform
us of the secrets of the Yale Band's Intelligence Division. It didn't take long. Her
debriefing was brief, and the chafing finally ceased. Therefore, the Band just underwent
training on how to act like the Yale &quot;Precision&quot; Marching Band.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were a few other things that we had to learn before we could come
out here and successfully act like the Yale Band (because Killer Gumbys don&#146;t just
walk funny).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though Jane escaped her mission unscathed, save a bit of rough skin,
we&#146;d like to contemplate what might have happened if the KGB, doubling as the other
Yale Band, had found her out. Watch now as the Yale band sends its demonstration of the
domino effect back to Brown in the form of a vamp and plays Stand Up Mambo.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that will remain
nameless for another few words, it&#146;s the Brown University &quot;Palmer? I Hardly Know
&#145;Er!&quot; BAND!!!</p>

<p>We&#146;d like to welcome you all to our show today. This is actually our first time
playing at the Vince Lombardi Memorial Rest Stop. There&#146;s only one thing confusing
us, though&#133;we can&#146;t find the Roy Rogers. Watch now as the Band pays tribute to
fast-food cuisine by forming a pigskin and playing something Foxy.</p>

<p>So now that we&#146;ve eaten, we&#146;re going to sit back and enjoy the smog for a

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just
christened the Vatican, it&#146;s the Brown University &quot;Holy WATER, Batman!&quot;
BAND!!!! Hello and welcome to Princeton&#146;s new stadium. For lack of a better
name&#133;well, for lack of a name, we&#146;ll call it the Electric Pussycat Swingers Club
for now. With the help of the Brown Archeological Recovery Fellows, BARF, the Band decided
to investigate Princeton&#146;s old stadium. After playing in the dirt for a while, we
came to a startling conclusion: the stadium was not built for football at all. Palmer
stadium was actually erected for two sports: pole wrestling and the Winter Naked Olympics.
(There was talk of a merged sport, but that fell by the waist-side.) The original plans
never had seating &#150; just poles for people to huddle and dance around. Watch now as
the band forms a Palmer seat and plays bring the victory &#150; wink, wink nudge, nudge,
know what I mean, know what I mean?</p>
<i>

<p><strong>Band Plays &quot;Bring the Victory&quot; and forms (rectangle??)</strong></p></i>

<p>The Band pondered this so-called &quot;pole wrestling,&quot; and wondered where such a
bizarre sport could have originated. But we think we have the answer: pole wrestling is
actually the modern descendent of that ancient sport, pole DANCING. In true Princeton
spirit, we&#146;d like to keep an old, crusty, outdated tradition alive by declaring this
new stadium a home for pole dancers everywhere. President Clinton recently heard about
this grand Princeton tradition and demanded a luxury box in the new stadium. Ahhhh, luxury
poll-dancing. Watch now as we toast President Clinton with a bottle of bubbly and play a
tune from down South.</p>
<i>

<p><strong>Band plays &quot;New Orleans&quot; and forms a bottle of champagne with bubbles
coming over the top. </strong></p></i>

<p>Speaking of champagne, we&#146;d like to share our real purpose in coming here today:
to christen the new stadium. Here&#146;s the list of names we came up with:</p>

University &quot;On a mission from God&quot; Band!!!</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Kyle and Pfeffer run screaming onto field, band straggles behind.)</strong></p></i>

<p>Today, we&#146;d like to welcome back the Brown Brothers, the Band&#146;s fearless
leadership. However, while the brothers took a few semesters off, the Band&#146;s uniforms
changed a bit. And while the Brown Band is a scatter band, without the leadership of the
Brown Brothers, the band has become even more scattered than it used to be. Watch now as
the Brown Brothers attempt to get the band back together and plays &quot;Hold On, I&#146;m
Comin.&#146;&quot;</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band forms sunglasses, plays &quot;Hold On, I&#146;m Comin.&#146;&quot;)</strong></p></i>

<p>The Band recently got shafted by Brown&#146;s shrunken endowment, which took a beating
when the stock market went down. With the band back together, it was able to muster up a
back beat&#133;or a beat back at the tiny endowment. Watch now as the band raises
hell&#133;that is, raises money&#133;by forming the stock market, collapsing, and playing
Gimme Some Money.</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band forms a stock graph (going down), does the domino band thing (percussion
could perhaps play a cadence or something here?) and plays &quot;Gimme Some
Lovin.&#146;&quot;)</strong></p></i>

<p>The band decided there was no better place to start fundraising than with President
Gee. He agreed to help under two conditions: that we play more country and western music
than we usually do, and that we add bow ties to our uniforms. Watch now as the band tries
to concede to these requests by forming a bow tie and playing &quot;Rawhide&quot;.</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band forms bow tie and plays &quot;Rawhide.&quot; Meanwhile, some bandies are
country line dancing and one is cracking a bullwhip.)</strong></p></i>

<p>Meanwhile, we had our share of troubles&#133;for instance, there was that time when our
fearful&#133;I mean, fearless, leaders were chased around by a maniacal woman brandishing
a Super Soaker. <i>(Kate Brucher chases Pfeff and Kyle around with a Super Soaker.) </i>But
maybe she was only looking for a little love. Watch now as the Band forms a heart and
plays &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love.&quot;</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band does just this.)</strong></p></i>

<p>While the Band&#146;s big guns were being pursued with a big water gun, President Gee
was coming up with a new test for the Band to prove its worth. He offered us this devious
challenge: if we could add 1 and 1, he would spring for new uniforms.</p>

<p>So, Band, what is one plus one?</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band starts scattering.)</strong></p></i>

<p>Watch now as the Band forms the answer.</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Pause, as Band continues scattering.)</strong></p></i>

<p>Uh&#133;it looks like the Band is a little confused on this one.</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Pause.)</strong></p></i>  

<p>What <i>is </i>one plus one, anyway? </p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band forms amorphous blob.)</strong></p></i>

<p>Watch now as the band sums up that thought by playing &quot;Think.&quot;</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band plays &quot;Think.&quot;)</strong></p></i>

<p>When Gee realized that there weren&#146;t any math concentrators in the Band, he
revised his test. &quot;Band,&quot; he asked, &quot;what is the seventh letter of the
alphabet?&quot; Unfortunately, when we studied the alphabet in preparation for this new
challenge, for some reason we couldn&#146;t get past the letter &quot;B.&quot; We decided
that the only thing to do was to flee in embarrassment. The Brown Brothers looked at each
other and declared, &quot;We&#146;re 106 miles from campus, we&#146;ve got fifty bandies,
we&#146;re tanked, and we&#146;re wearing sunglasses. Hit it.&quot;</p>

Today&#146;s topic will be neuroscience. The tectospinal and rubrospinal descending motor
pathways decussate anterior to the pons, while the vestibulospinal tract and
reticulospinal tract do not decussate. Ultimately, however, descending cortical pathways
are the most important muscular control routes, as electrophysiological stimulation of the
M1 and premotor regions of the cortex often result in random twitching. <b><i>(Band gets a
leg twitch)</i> </b>and OH NO! It looks like the entire band is suffering from a

experimental cinema at Upenn. Coinciding with these plans, a specialty foods market is
also to be built. The Brown Band wondered at the juxtaposition of these two edifices, and

the movie snack bar: </p>

&#150; starting with the magazine most read for its articles, Playboy. To most effectively
plot their takeover, the aliens (through Playboy) launched a revealing [beat] survey about
what would turn on a Cornell student, so that they could eugenically breed creatures that
would be under the mind control of the Brown Band! Muahahaha! So what <i>does </i>turn on
a Cornell student, anyway?</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just a swig
o&#146; root beer, it&#146;s the Brown University &quot;We got bite&quot; Band!</p>

<p>The band recently heard about the travesty that is the Harvard Beer Company. It&#146;s
entirely understandable that the administration is suing; I don&#146;t think they ever
received their free kegs. And to think &#150; they were on the verge of changing the
school motto to In Beero Veritas. Such a shame. Watch now as the band forms a smooshed keg
and plays &quot;Bring me a beverage, you foxy wench!&quot;</p>

<p>We're happy to be here in germ-infested Cambridge. In fact, the band is looking into
enhancing their sound much the same way the Harvard band has with their whooping cough
section. Well, at least I&#146;m up here, not subject to all of that&#133; [break into
coughing fit]. Ugh! It&#146;s everywhere! With this recent outbreak of disease in Harvard,
at least those Harvard students don't have to worry about STDs. Watch now as the band
blows its nose and plays <i><b>Bring the Kleenex</b></i>.</p>

<p>In fact, a number of Harvard students from the past have serious debilitating diseases.
FDR had polio, and Bill Gates suffers from acute desire to rule the world. Bill Gates
recently announced his intention to take over the world on January 1st, 2000. He recorded
the speech using voice recognition software. The following is an excerpt: &quot; by a hot
you beautiful weekly earthly is will be made to buy all my software play by instant big

<p>We heard that Harvard students also contend with big head disease. Besides the more
obvious problems big head disease causes, such as getting jammed in doorways or having
charicature-like portraits, we discovered many other, less-obvious life-situations which
arise with a big head. The following is a list of these plights:</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, uncles and aunties!<br>
Friends and alumni, grandpas and grannies!<br>
We proudly present a grupulous group<br>
That will wow you all down with a hearty ka-zoop!<br>
So all of you fans, let&#146;s give them a hand!<br>
It&#146;s the Brown University &quot;Buppulous&quot; Band!</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band gallops onto field, forms champagne glass.)</strong></p></i>

<p>And now the Band offers a mighty big thanks<br>
Some hugs and some kisses, some kicks and some spanks<br>
To all the big seniors who are going away<br>
Their time of departure: some morning, next May<br>
So watch as the Band forms a big glass of bubbly<br>
And toasts all the seniors, right on the doubly. </p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Bits and Pieces)</strong></p></i>

<p>First there&#146;s Barb Green, who carries her sheep<br>
Everywhere&#151;on the bus, on the field, in her sleep.<br>
She feeds us with Twizzlers, she wears her long tail<br>
A most loyal bandie, who&#146;s here without fail.<br>
</p>

<p>From the state of New York comes a banger named Adam<br>
The Band has been glad for the four years we&#146;ve had him<br>
While he is with us, he bangs on the snare<br>
And gives loyal athletic support to the Bears.</p>

<p>For the purpose of verse, we&#146;ll call him Mike Zwarge<br>
Which is helpful: he&#146;s tall, not to mention he&#146;s large.<br>
He like-a to swing, he teaches us all,<br>
It&#146;s Michael Zwarg&#151;&quot;Whaddaya mean it&#146;s last call?&quot;</p>

<p>Now we have Persky, whose first name is Jon<br>
A bandie so long that his liver&#146;s half gone<br>
He&#146;s not here today, due to overexhaustion<br>
But John Persky, we hail thee with loyal devotion. </p>

<p>Lastly, a bandie who knows what a flask&#146;s for<br>
She writes papers about us&#151;what more could we ask for?<br>
Our illustrious student conductor, it&#146;s Kate<br>
She keeps us in rhythm, and what&#146;s more, she makes sure we start and finish on
time&#151;oh, wait&#133;</p>
<i><font size="4"><b>

<p>Halftime:</p></b></font></i>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, daddies and mommies,<br>
Friends and alumni, fascists and commies, <br>
Presenting an organization that toots<br>
On clarinets, trumpets, kazoos, and some flutes. <br>
And so, without further ado, give a hand<br>
To the Brown Unversity &quot;Air-Breathing&quot; Band!</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band charges field.)</strong></p></i>

<p>And now let&#146;s pay tribute to Newton K. Gingrich<br>
He&#146;s finally done with Congressional flings, which<br>
Will leave him quite free to go where he may<br>
And we&#146;re mightily glad that he&#146;s going away!<br>
But where will he go? And how will he travel?<br>
Perhaps he will ride on a bear that eats gravel.<br>
Perhaps he will go to the North on the backs<br>
Of two or three Nibbulous North-Going Zax.<br>
Or maybe he&#146;ll travel a river-y route<br>
And swim to Pa-Wunk in a pinstriped wetsuit.<br>
Or tour the far-FAR-away Land of Lazarmy.<br>
And perhaps he will take with him Richard K. Armey.<br>
Watch now as the Band forms a Congress sans Newt<br>
And plays the song &quot;Aqualung&quot; as a salute.</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band does this.)</strong></p></i>

<p>We&#146;ve heard that the companies Pepsi and Coke<br>
Are competing for rights to make Dartmouth folks broke.<br>
But who really wants either one of those colas?<br>
They kill your digestion and rot out your molas.<br>
They eat up your liver and waltz with your spleen&#133;<br>
Oh, we could go on till two-thousand-nineteen.<br>
And who says that money and corporate leverage<br>
Should determine a campus&#146;s choices of beverage?<br>
And so we would like to bring onto the scene<br>
A new type of drink for the folks at Big Green.<br>
Its name shall be &quot;Moose Juice.&quot; From that, please deduce <br>
That Moose Juice is simply the juice of a moose.<br>
Its flavor is moosey. Its color is spruce.<br>
It&#146;s endorsed by one Thickwit, the Green-Hearted Moose!<br>
Watch now as the band forms a moose&#146;s long <i>(half a beat)</i> antler,<br>
And plays &quot;Pepsico Inferno&quot; before we dismantl&#146;er.</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band does this too.)</strong></p></i>

<p>And now for this segment, a quick dedication<br>
To thirty great years of Band coeducation.<br>
It all started back in the year &#146;68<br>
When some poor Brown Bandie could not find a date.<br>
So instead of pursuing the street corner strumpet<br>
He sought out the girls who knew how to play trumpet.<br>
He ended his search, he came back with fifty<br>
All playing instruments varied and nifty.<br>
There was May-Betty-Lou on the didgeridoo,<br>
And Lola-Lee-Looka who played the kazoo.<br>
On afuge-cabasa, twas Sue-Patty-Lee,<br>
And a Fluble horn handled by Ellen Marie.<br>
Watch now as the Band toots away on their horns<br>
And forms a large B for the Brown Women Born.</p>
<i>

<p><strong>(Band forms B, plays BMB.)</strong></p></i>

<p>That&#146;s all for today, so we&#146;ll now be bye-byein&#146;<br>
Join us next week as we take on the Lions.</p>

<p><strong>(Band attacks the field.)</strong></p></i>

<p>To the Editor:</p>

<p>It has recently come to my attention that the Brown University quote-unquote Band will
be playing at today&#146;s football game, and I just want to make it clear that I&#146;m
offended. I say we cancel today&#146;s game. Forfeit. Award the victory to Brown, just to
keep their godforsaken band off the field. Come to think of it, how can a fine institution
such as Brown even consider calling itself by the color that the band wears? For that
matter, how can we even stand to live in America, seeing as how the band plays our
national anthem? Let&#146;s blow up this planet! It&#146;s where the band lives. Well, so
long. I have to go to my tone-deaf dog&#146;s recital. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dan Gati.</p>

<p>Thanks, Dan. We appreciate your quote-unquote criticism. But we have one question: do
football players go to job interviews dressed as they are for football games?</p>

<p>OK, OK. By now, you&#146;ve ALL heard about the Brown grad student who tried to poison
his ex-girlfriend with radioactive iodine. But frankly, we don&#146;t see why people are
making such a big deal about it. Heck, people poison each other with radioactive iodine
all the time at <i>Columbia</i>. You just don&#146;t notice, since the entire New York
metropolitan area is radioactive. So please, get a half-life! Besides, we can think of
better ways to kill OUR lovers. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Brown Band proudly

<p>Hi. I&#146;m Senator Al D&#146;Amato, and I&#146;m here to talk about an exciting new
product for the people of New York. Are you tired of the stench of polluted air and water?
Too lazy to get off the couch and do something about it? Well, who needs the EPA, anyway?
Not us! Instead, try my new deodorant, Columbia Roll-On! Just spread some on, and
you&#146;ll never have to notice pollution again!</p>
