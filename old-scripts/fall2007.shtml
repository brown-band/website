<h2>Duquesne</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and alumni, presenting an organization that rock and rolls all night and parties every day, it’s the Brown University “Duquesne, Duquesne, Duquesne, Duquesne, Goose-quesne!” BAND!
</p>
<p>All summer, the band has waited for this moment.  Right here, right now, this is what it’s all about.  First football game of the year, and we’re playing…who?  The Duquesne Dukes?  And the award for the most unoriginal nickname in Division 1-AA goes to…you guessed it, these guys.  What is a duke anyway?  Some old English dude with a lot of land.  In real life, any duke would run the other way when seeing a bear.  On the gridiron, things are no different.  Zak DeOssie may be playing on Sundays now, but there is still enough talent on the Brown bench to dominate.  Watch now as the band forms a football and scores on Duquesne “Any Way We Want To.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms a football, plays “Any Way You Want It.”</em>
</p>
<p>But enough about you, how has MY summer been?  Here at Brown, things have been going swimmingly.  The band practiced all summer, twice a day, learned 15 new songs, and finally decided to learn how to march---actually we all did “research” or had “internships.”  How lame.  Futures.  Seriously though, the band has been looking forward to a great season, including such highlights as Harvard’s first ever night game.  Watch now as the band forms a B and delibirately fails its classes so we can all be at “Brown Forever More.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms a B, plays #3.</em></p>

<div class="even"><h3>Half Time</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that likes expectations nice and low, it’s the Brown University “Band” BAND!!
</p>
<p>Coming back to campus is always fun.  Seeing your friends, welcoming the freshmen, starting new classes, its all part of the college ritual.  Those of us that have been her six or seven years may be getting tired of this, but we always have that third stab at calculus to look forward to.  “Daddy, I know I would make such a good doctor but I just can’t pass any of the pre-med classes!  Give me one more try and I promise I can do it.”  Those of us who are seniors are looking out of the ivory tower, and staring back at us the REAL WORLD! AHH!  Jobs, bills, kids, the thought of it all is just terrifying.  If only we could be as the freshmen, frolicking on the main green without a care in the world.  Want to take all intro courses? Sure!  Don’t have any idea what you want to do with your life?  Me either!  Man, those were the days.  Watch now as the band forms an ivory tower and yearns for the good old days when Michael Jackson was a cute kid with an afro by playing “I Want You Back.”  
</p>

<p><em>Band forms a ivory tower, plays “I Want You Back."</em>
</p>
<p>Speaking of the summer two years before an election, who do you think is going to win the presidency in 2008?  Will it be Hillary, Barak, Mitt?  While we don’t claim to be as knowledgeable as Tim Russert, the band would like to offer some things to watch out for as the election season nears ever closer.
<br><br>A. Next year, Mike Gravel will come out with a new commercial of himself staring into the camera, followed by him throwing a rock into a lake.  Oh that happened? See, you can’t make this stuff up!
<br>B. Be on the lookout for an underdog to come in and take the election away from one of the main contenders.  Sorry Senator McCain, you don’t count.
<br>C. More stock shots of Dennis Kucinich’s wife during debates.
<br>D. Every day is one day closer to not having to hear any more about the presidential election!
<br>E. Every day is one day closer to the beginning of the next round of election jibba-jabba!
<br>	F. The Princeton Band!
</p>
<p>Watch now as the band forms a butterfly ballot and plays the name we were called when abroad in Prague last semester.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms a butterfly ballot, plays “American Idiot."</em>
</p>
<p>Usually, halftime is a democratic institution, shared equally by bands from both schools.  However, this week we have staged a hostile takeover of the Duquesne Band and stolen their show.  They were going to make fun of us for having no grades and an ultra-liberal student body, but we ripped their script up.  Instead we are going to form a B and play the Brown Cheering Song to drown out their imaginary sound.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms a B, plays #2 hockey style.</em>
</p>
<p>Well that about does ‘er for us this week.  Another day, another doggie to round up.  But stay tuned, because next week we’ll be at Ha’vahd under the brand new lights.  I heard the light is so brilliant it shines money, and that the campus walks are paved in gold.  Are these rumors true?  To find out, you’ll have to come.

<h2>Harvard</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that beat a Catholic school in football last weekend, it’s the Brown University “L’Chaim!!” BAND!
</p>
<p>The band was extremely dismayed upon originally learning that this game was scheduled to be on the eve of Yom Kippur.  Oy Vey!  What’s a person (poisen) to do- watch Harvard alums cry while losing, or observe the most important fast of the Jewish year?  While the choice was clear to those of us in attendance, the ignorance of the schedule makers was comical.  How could you not know that it was Yom Kippur?  At Harvard!  It must have been that “world-class education” you’re all getting! Watch now as the band forms a dreidel and plays the only Jewish song we know.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms dreidel, plays “Havah Negila.</em>
</p>
<p>Besides the lights, we’ve noticed some changes here in Cambridge, and I’m not talking about Drew Faust’s new pants suit.  Apparently, Harvard has become Hogwarts over the summer.  Just listen to this quote from the university’s website: “Harvard Square is a magical place, where centuries of tradition meet a cutting-edge urban sensibility. Every year millions of people are drawn here, from every corner of the globe. They come to 
learn, to teach, to discover, and to enjoy.”  Honestly, that is the most ridiculous quote possible to be on the front of the Harvard website.  The only thing to do in this situation is form a B and remind ourselves that we are all Brown People Born
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays “Brown Man Born."</em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="even"><h3>Half Time</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that looks just as good with the lights on, it’s the Brown University “I’ve got your Big Dig right here” BAND!!
</p>
<p>With all the changes going on in Boston today, its no wonder most people didn’t care when Harvard installed new lights in their stadium.  The Brown Band, however, likes the lights but is not sure of their ethical place on such a “progressive” campus as Harvard.  Aren’t these lights contributing to global warming?  We think so, and you know kids, if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem.  But wait- maybe the Harvard administration had an ulterior motive for these lights.  Maybe they are sending mind-control waves down into our brains, making us believe that Harvard is everything they say it is?!?!? Watch now as the band forms mind-control waves,  freaks out and plays “Crazy Train.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms waves, plays “Crazy Train."</em>
</p>
<p>How about the football game that’s been going on?  Pretty good, eh?  Actually, how would we know?  We most certainly didn’t write this script during the first quarter.  But the alto sax section did alert Brown Coach Phil Estes to some disturbing activities that were going on down on the Harvard sideline.  It seems one of the Crimson’s coaches was videotaping our defensive calls and telling his players when we were going to blitz— Oh wait, that was the other football team from Massachusetts, and we’re not talking about UMass.  Watch now as the Band circles the wagons to protect the integrity of the game and tells the Harvard’s coaching staff to “Beat It.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms a circle, plays “Beat It."</em>
</p>
<p>In related news, the Band is here to announce that rumors of Britney Spears’ comeback have been greatly exaggerated.  Her performance during the most recent MTV Video Music Awards had many of our members rushing to record companies looking for deals as pop stars.  But Diddy didn’t bite our sales pitch, so don’t hold your breath waiting for a Brown student to become the next Hilary Duff.  Who are we kidding, anyway?  When the artist formerly known as Mrs. Federline’s career becomes such a joke that she plays the halftime for the Harvard Yale game, we would be happy to be her backing band.  After all, her dancing is about as good as our singing.  At least we try- sometimes.  Watch now as the band forms a B and plays the Britney Cheering Song.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays #2.</em>
</p>
<p>Join us next week for a stuffie and some chowdah as Brown welcomes URI to Providence.  “Ram ‘er? I hardly know ‘er!”
</p>
<p><em>#1 off  the field.</em>
</p>

<h2>URI</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that really isn’t so Awful Awful, it’s the Brown University “Rhode Island? How about Rogue’s Island!” BAND!!!
</p>
<p>Today the band puts it all on the line, going head to head with the URI band for the coveted Governor’s Cup.  This year, we are really going to try and win it.  What?  You have to march to win the Governor’s Cup?  Well then, you guys can have it—but first, can we see it for a second?  GULP!  Now we are really ready for the game!  Watch as the band forms the Cup, and plays the Fox Sports theme to get us all psyched up.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms Governor’s Cup, plays “Fox Sports."</em>
</p>
<p>We really appreciate the extra effort the URI Band made by coming up here for this game.  A source close to the Marching Ram Band told us that while en route, one of the trumpets finished his senior thesis by proving that it is possible to drive for an hour and still be in the state of Rhode Island.  It’s really amazing what Sociology Departments are doing these days.  Now that both bands are here, we say “Lets Get it On!”  Watch now as the band forms a B, croons like Marvin Gaye, and plays “In the Fray.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays “In the Fray."</em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="even"><h3>Half Time</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants an extra stuffie with that cabinet, it’s the Brown University “Buddy in 08!” BAND!!!
</p>
<p>"It can be of little doubt that if the State of Rhode Island was separated from the Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under the popular form of government, within such narrow limits would be displayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities that some power altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule has proved the necessity of it.”  What does this quote from James Madison, one of America’s founders, mean?  Watch now as the band forms a factious majority, and uses these words as a Vehicle for discussion.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms factious majority, plays “Vehicle."</em>
</p>
<p>What Mr. Madison was trying to say was that if Rhode Island were to refuse to sign the Constitution, the nation would fail due to the weight of its competing factions. But times have changed, and Rhode Island is about so much more than that.  It’s about coffee milk, Family Guy, and turf farming.  What’s more American than that?  Maybe the only thing the Brown and URI bands can agree on is that our state, whether we have lived here for only a year or our entire lives with no plans to move, gets no respect on the national stage.  We demand recognition as the birthplace of religious toleration and the donut shop!  Watch now as the band forms our favorite tasty snack and makes its demands known by playing “Gimme Some Lovin.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms donut, plays “Gimme Some Lovin."</em>
</p>
<p>Ultimately we must all ask ourselves this: what does it mean to be from Rhode Island?  If you trust the words of Roger Williams, it’s a place where all people are free to worship and live as they please.  What Cheer?!  But, if you take the mascots of Brown and URI as guides, the only animal life in the state consists of Bears and Rams.  Soon, however, the bears would eat all the rams, and reign supreme o’er Narragansett Bay.  The band chooses the latter explanation, and relishes the chance to meet the URI band in head-to-head competition.  Forming a B, the band plays “Brown Bear” to root its mascot on to victory.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays “Brown Bear."</em>

<p>Join us next week as Brown welcomes the Holy Cross Crusaders to Providence and gives them a lesson in math.  1+1+1=1????????

<h2>Holy Cross</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that takes theology pass/fail, it’s the Brown University “Crusader? I hardly know ‘er!” BAND!
</p>
<p>The band welcomes Holy Cross this weekend, all the way from Worcester.  All we have to say is, we are so happy it wasn’t an away game this year.  Not that Worcester isn’t a nice city or anything, but it’s just not the kind of place that any of us want to spend another hour in- ever again.  But seriously, we bet it’s a chill place once you live there for a while.  Right.  One thing we do love is football, and that’s what’s on the agenda for today.  Today’s game promises to be biblical in scope, which suits the band just fine.  Watch now as the band forms a fish and plays “Joshua.” 
</p>
<p><em>Band forms fish, plays “Joshua.”</em>
</p>
<p>Initially, the band was exited by the prospect of traveling to Bury, England to play Holy Cross in football.  But a quick check of Wikipedia revealed our mistake- at least ten colleges around the world are named “Holy Cross.”  Come on, a little originality please!  There are plenty of colors still available as college names.  Taupe, Hazel, Mauve, and Fuchsia are all great options.  Brown is taken, though.  In case you forgot, watch now as the band forms a B and reminds you that we are loyal to Brown Forevermore.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays #3.</em></p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that was founded on religious toleration, it’s the Brown University “In deo speramus!” BAND!
</p>
<p>The year is 1492.  Christopher Columbus has just landed on the island of Cuba.  Thinking that it was actually India, he sets foot on shore and goes to look for gold, spices, and anything else of value.  Flash forward to 2007.  The band steps off into its own personal hell-- class!  Last night we stayed up all night writing a paper.  The assignment asked us to imagine being on Columbus’ expedition.  What would you do when confronted with a vast unknown continent?  What would you tell the native peoples living along the coast?  Watch now as the band forms the Santa Maria, and channels the true Boss to explain our argument.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms boat, plays “Born to Run.”</em>
</p>
<p>All the way to his grave, Columbus contended that he had in fact found a route to Asia.  Now we know that in fact he was wrong, he had in fact discovered a new continent.  Who wouldn’t want to claim that as one’s finest achievement?   Amerigo Vespucci may have gotten to put his name on the New World, but Columbus is the one who we credit with the discovery.  But why?  This guy gets a national holiday named after him, but he wouldn’t even admit his feat!?  Wishing he would at least own up to his part in the largest cultural takeover in the history of the world, watch now as the band forms a flag, claims its ground, and plays “My Continent.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms flag, plays “My Sharona.”</em>
</p>
<p>The band really does believe that all sides of Columbus’ story should be told.  That’s why we have broken into the competitive world of publishing.  Our first book is going to be called “Ride Me: The Story of Christopher Columbus’ Horse.”  It tells the story of a young filly, Muffin, and her life of adventure.  Born on a farm outside Seville, she was picked by Columbus as his most prized horse.  She was on the Santa Maria during the first voyage to the Americas, and the book outlines her harrowing voyage below the deck of that famous vessel.  Finally, it includes her untimely death, as starving crewmembers enjoyed her in a delicious horse stew.  Look for it in bookstores this December- makes a perfect Christmas gift!  But if that falls through, we always have music.  Watch now as the band forms a B and plays the Brown Cheering Song.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays #2.</em>
</p>
<p>Join us in Providence again next week as Brown welcomes Princeton for homecoming.  The Princeton Alumni Association will be giving Rolexes to the first 500 fans, so get here early!

<h2>Princeton</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has Nick Cannon on its drumline, it’s the Brown University “One band, one” BAND!!!!!
</p>
<p>This weekend, the band welcomes all the alumni back for Homecoming.  However, our parents are conspicuously absent.  Their weekend is in two weeks.  Why the need to separate the various adults that make it possible for us to be here at Brown?  We love them all equally, and that goes for their financial stability as well.  Without these fine people, we’d all be flippin’ burgers.  But really, the band just wants to get down.  Watch now as we form tiger eyes and play “Jungle Boogie.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms tiger eyes, plays “Jungle Boogie.”</em>
</p>
<p>We also welcome the Princeton Tigers and their plaid-clad band this weekend.  When we win this game today, we all plan on going to our fountain and playing Rock Lobster.  Except the only fountain on our campus is pretty shallow and has what looks like a large string of beads in the center.  We are going to do it though.  Maybe.  We still love Brown- that’s for sure.  Watch now as the band demonstrates its commitment to the Brunonian cause, forming a B and playing “For Bruno and For Brown.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays #4.</em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="even"><h3>Half Time</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that takes all its classes S/NC, it’s the Brown University “There can’t be grade inflation without grades” BAND!!
</p>
<p>The Princeton faculty has recently been pursuing a policy of grade deflation at Old Nassau.  This has been seen as a shock to many Princeton students, who view their admission letter as a ticket to straight As and a bright future.  WRONG!  Daddy can buy you many things, but there’s no hiding the fact that you don’t do your reading and write bad papers.  This trend has many Tigers wishing for days gone by.  Watch now as the band helps them achieve their dreams, forming an A and playing “Time Warp.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms A, plays “Time Warp.”</em>
</p>
<p>At Brown, every student loves the New Curriculum, and there is no grade inflation.  We have prepared a short list that explains the subtleties of academics at Brown.  When you take a class, the possible grades are:
<br>A.	B
<br>B.	C
<br>C.	S
<br>D.	A
<br>E.	NC
<br>F.	THE PRINCETON BAND!!!</p>
<p>See, wasn’t that easy?  Now the band will form a SciLi, study for its “Psychology of Grading” midterm, and play “I Touch Myself.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms SciLi, plays “I Touch Myself.”</em>
</p>
<p>Its all too easy to forget that Princeton played Rutgers in the first ever College Football game.  The year was 1869; Ulysses S. Grant was the President of the United States.  In what was a sign of things to come, Princeton lost that first meeting.  Judging by the current states of these two football programs, it’s safe to say that there won’t soon be a debate about the best college football teams in New Jersey.  Do the words “Championship Subdivision” mean anything to you?  Probably not.  By the time this history lesson is over, the band will have likely already formed a B.  Watch now as they pay homage to the seventh oldest school in the country and proclaim the supremacy of “Brown Forevermore.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays #3.</em>
</p>
<p>Next week, the band travels to Cornell to take on the Reds.  We will be joined on the field by Senator Joe McCarthy!  Tune in to find out what hilarious antics ensue!

<h2>Cornell</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that “At Cornell, you will live and learn with more than 13,000 undergraduates from the United States and 120 countries around the world, who represent diverse ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. You can share your experiences as you participate in activities ranging from visual and performing arts and athletics to cultural and professional organizations,” its the Brown University “Big Red What?” BAND!!!
</p>
<p>The schools that fall under the umbrella of Cornell University are:
<br>The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences* 
<br>The College of Architecture, Art, and Planning
<br>The College of Arts and Sciences

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization with more talent than Steve Miller, it’s the Brown University “No, we’re not going to play ‘The Joker’” BAND!
</p>
<p>The Brown Band has not been to Cornell in four years, so we did some research to jog our memory of what it’s like up here.  We found out some interesting things.  You know, “You might think the Cornell campus is so big that it should have its own zip code. It is and it does. But one of the first things you'll notice when you arrive is that student residences are organized into communities, designed with options, amenities, and recreational and learning opportunities that promote interaction and make the campus feel smaller.”  Watch now as the band forms the McGraw Tower and keeps its housing options open, playing “Any Way You Want It.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms McGraw Tower, plays “Any Way You Want It.”</em>
</p>
<p>The motto of Cornell is, "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study." Cornell is the federal land-grant institution of New York State, a private endowed university, a member of the Ivy League/Ancient Eight, and a partner of the State University of New York. It has been described as the first truly American university because of its founders' revolutionarily egalitarian and practical vision of higher education, and is dedicated to its land-grant mission of outreach and public service.  Watch now as the band forms the Dark Lord’s ship and pays homage to these ideals by playing a song that you already know.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms tie fighter, plays “Imperial March.”</em>
</p>
<p>Cornell was chartered in 1865. Opening Day ceremonies were held on October 7, 1868; the total enrollment was 412 students.  Cornell's colors are carnelian and white.  By comparison, Brown was chartered in 1764.  Its colors are cardinal red and seal brown.  We here at the Brown Band love tradition just as Cornell does.  That’s why we are going to play a very special song this afternoon.  Watch now as the band forms a B and resurrects the “Pembroke Cheering Song”, from our old women’s college.  
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays “Pembroke Cheering Song.”</em>

<h2>Penn</h2>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that microwaves itself every morning for breakfast; it’s the Brown University “your mascot is the oatmeal dude?” BAND!!!
</p>
<p>The band has been doing some research on UPenn’s founder, and we’ve come to some conclusions about Ben Franklin.  At best he was a reckless inventor and a mediocre politician.  I mean, who in their right mind goes out in a storm and puts a key on a kite string?  That’s asking to get electrocuted!  Watch now as the band forms a key and plays the words Ben spoke after realizing that he had zapped his internal organs.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms key, plays “I Want You Back.”</em>
</p>
<p>Aside from the Phillies and Eagles seasons, there have been a number of interesting developments this year at Penn.  After heavy fighting resulting in thousands of casualties, Penn finally completed its hostile takeover of Drexel over the summer.  Also, at a recent press conference, Penn State Football coach Joe Paterno (Brown alum from 1950!!) referred to his school as UPenn, thereby resurrecting that ever present ambiguity that Penn has sought to avoid, especially after the Smith-Patton Incident of 1957.  Watch now as the band forms a B, remains above this controversy and plays “Brown Bear.”

<br>B.	Soap.  I ran out weeks ago…

<p>Parents are great.  They love you no matter what you do.  Almost.  But the band still feels like they’re letting their parents down.  What about Gandhi’s parents?  They had something to brag about.  Even Johnny Cash’s dad reconciles with him at the end of “Walk the Line.”  Still, at the end of the day we know our parents wouldn’t trade us for anything.  Watch now as the band shows some love and plays the proudest moment for Billy Joel’s parents. 
</p>
<p><em>Band forms heart, plays “Uptown Girl”.</em>
</p>
<p>Parents weekend leads to the inevitable conversation that begins with the ten scariest words a college student can hear: What are you going to do with your life?  Oh, that was actually nine words?  Well then, I guess investment banking is out.  The band really just wants to follow its heart and go pro in scramble band-ing.  Seriously though, if anyone is looking for a witty writer with a strong humanities background and solid work ethic, contact the scriptwriter though email.  Thanks in advance.  Watch now as the band forms a B and enters into the Brown Alumni network “forevermore.”

</p>
<p>So Yale has Harvard on the run all the way to Canada.  No, its not the Pequot War, I’m talking about GoCrossCampus, the online massive multiplayer Risk-type game currently being waged amongst the schools of the Ivy League.  Columbia’s days are also numbered, and Dartmouth is on the ropes in northern New York.  That leaves only Cornell, Princeton and us, noble Brunonia to defeat the evil Empire and conquer New England in the name of all that is good.  Watch now as the band forms a ________, remembers the sport that is being played on the field and plays “NFL on Fox.”
</p>

<p>In recent news, the Columbia army retook Jericho, and Yale defeated us at New London.  This effectively leaves Brown at Mission Critical.  Those backstabbing Columbians- we should have known!  Even Napoleon got a second chance after defeat, and we’re still hoping ours comes.  If not, we solemnly swear to defend Fall River to the death- Bruno does not go down without a fight!  Also, who has been attacking those servers?  Possibly an Eli?  Watch now as the band rallys the troops, playing the Rhode Island classic “Brown Forever More.”

<h2>Dartmouth</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Senior honors and limericks.</p>
</div>
<div class="even"><h3>Half Time</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s happy its not Hanover in New Hampshire, it’s the Brown University “Green is the color of puke” BAND!
</p>
<p>The band was extremely happy to not make the trip up to Dartmouth this year.  Its not that we don’t like the wilderness, it’s just that we wouldn’t want to go to school there.  We would, however, enjoy going to Australia, home of the Dartmouth Dam on the Mitta Mitta River.  We hear the trout fishing is great!  We would also surely enjoy a cruise on the HMS Dartmouth, a World War I light cruiser.  Triple Alliance, beware the Brown Band!  Whatever Dartmouth you choose, make sure it’s not Dartmouth College.  Watch now as the band forms New Hampshire, and explains how we leave the Live Free or Die state.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms NH, plays “Vehicle."</em>
</p>
<p>Dartmouth’s motto is a clear sign that all is not right on Wentworth Street.  In Latin, it is “Vox clamantis in deserto,” which translates as “The voice of one crying in the wilderness.”  This is not the uplifting motto that we would like to see from an Ivy League institution.  “In deo speramus:” now there’s a motto!  “In god we hope.”  Word up.  There’s no crying in the liberal arts!  Well maybe there is sometimes, if you really need an extension because your computer broke and your cousin is in the hospital…<SOB>.  Watch now as the band forms a single tear and plays “I Want You Back.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms tear, plays “I Want You Back."</em>
</p>
<p>In order to really drive our point home, the band would like to close our halftime show with a list of reasons why Rhode Island is better than New Hampshire.
<br>A. Coffee Milk
<br>B. Family Guy
<br>C. Tax Free alcohol (ok, so you guys get that one)
<br>D. The Burning of the Gaspee- The FIRST act of the American Revolution
<br>E. James Woods
<br>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!
</p>
<p>Watch now as the band forms its final B and shows you that we are loyal To Bruno and To Brown.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays #4.</em>
</p>
<p>Thanks for a great football season.  Starting TONIGHT, look for the band at hockey and basketball games.  Bruno does not hibernate during the winter!!

<h2>Columbia</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that isn’t afraid to clog its arteries, it’s the Brown University “Baconator? I hardly know her!” BAND!
</p>
<p>On the way down to Columbia last night, the band stopped at Burger King and a philosophical debate ensued over the merits of the Quadruple BK Stacker vs. Wendy’s Baconator.  Apparently, some people prefer a united attack of bacon on their mouth, while others love theirs in Lincoln-log fashion.  They agreed to disagree and find common ground in their true love for the greasy mess of meat in their mouths.  Watch now as the band forms the burger with inset bacon and pays tribute to the fourth meal with the playing of “Midnight Special.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms burger and bacon, plays “Midnight Special."</em>
</p>
<p>The Brown Band would like to take this opportunity to advocate on behalf of stew.  For too long, stew has been a neglected part of many people’s definition of soup.  We believe that stews of all kinds should take their rightful place next to chicken noodle and split pea soup.  No longer shall stew remain in the shadows, unable to claim its heritage as part of the bowl-ed tradition of liquid meals.  In honor of this noble food, watch now as the band forms a B and lets you know what our mascot would do to a bowl of stew.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays “Brown Bear."</em>

<div class="even"><h3>Half Time</h3>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves to pwn n00bs hardkore, it’s the Brown University “MAKE IT STOP!” BAND!
</p>
<p>As this season draws to an end, we the Brown Band are reminded of the end of other great series.  Harry Potter, the seventh book that devastated the world with the revelation about Dumbledore’s “orientation.”  Who can forget Star Wars—but should we be remembering Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith—who knows? And of course, Lord of the Rings, the epic whose tragic hero, Gollum, we all love and miss.  I guess all things must come to an end.  Watch now as the band forms the One Ring, and signals the Final Countdown on the season.
</p>
<p><em>Band forms ring, plays “Final Countdown."</em>
</p>
<p>Finally, this afternoon the band really just wants to dance.
</p>
<p>Let’s go to work 
<br>To the left, take it back now ya’ll 
<br>2 hops this time, 2 hops this time 
<br>Right foot 2 stomps, left foot 2 stomps 
<br>Hands on your knees, hands on your knees 
<br>Get funky with it, aahhhhhhhhhh yaaaa 
<br>Come on, Cha Cha now ya’ll
<br>Freeze, Everybody Clap yo hands!
<br>Band claps for a few seconds>
<br><br>Watch now as the band forms a B and reminds itself that we are “Brown People Dancing.”
</p>
<p><em>Band forms B, plays “Brown Man Born.”</em>
</p>
<p>We would like to thank you for a great football season.  We know that you weren’t here for most of it, because we’re not in Providence, we’re in New York. But thanks anyway.
</p>
<p><em>#1 off the field.</em></p>
