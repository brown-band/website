<h2>Brown (7) vs. Harvard (24)</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that puts the <b>[REDACTED]</b> in <b>[REDACTED]</b> it&apos;s the Brown University &rdquo;30 minutes or more, we&apos;ll still take it!!&ldquo; BAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNND!</p>

<p>Hello, everyone! We&apos;re just as surprised to be here as you are! The Brown Band has quite a history of missing our pregame show due to horrifying Boston traffic and parking difficulties in HAHVAHD YAHD... but we managed to get here on time this year. So I&apos;m going to wing it and tell my funniest Harvard jokes. People at Harvard are ugly. They stole their mascot from Alabama! ROLL TIDE! Harvard men are really tough; they know how to knit and stuff. Harvard women don&apos;t exist because Harvard is sexist. How many Harvard students does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Five, because they&apos;re ugly! A Harvard man walks into a bar. Everyone starts crying.</p>

<p><i>Band forms L-O-L and plays &ldquo;Livin&apos; On a Prayer in Order to Survive Traffic.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>I guess I&apos;ll just talk about this great movie I saw over the summer. Once upon
a time there was a math whiz from Southie, a bank robber from Charlestown and an
Irish mobster, also from Southie. One day, the Irish mobster decided to induct the
math whiz into the mob by making him go undercover in the Massachusetts state
police. As the math whiz balances basic training at police academy and algorithms
at MIT, the mobster breaks the whiz&apos;s ahm for wasting his time. One day, while
attending a game at Fenway Pahk, the whiz notices a bank robber, the one from
Charlestown, trying to rob the stadium. The whiz feels obligated to stop the robbery,
but the mobster threatens to break his other ahm if he does, because the mobster
has a stake in the robbery. But the whiz pushes the mobster off a building, Mahky
Mahk and the Funky Bunch shoot Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Renner got dressed up
as a nun and then shot and Robin Williams helps the whiz catch the robber. When
the whiz and the robber first see each other, they are instantly friends, and decide to
write movies together. After initial success as screenwriters, they fade into the back
as actors, and Sean Bean dies, Anthony Anderson too. </p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that was
recently downgraded by Standard and Poor&apos;s, it&apos;s the Brown University &ldquo;now we&apos;re
just poor!&rdquo; BAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNND!</p>

<p>Speaking of money, did you guys hear about how rich the Harvard Band is?
We as an organization were recently informed that the Harvard Band is RICH.</p>

<p>In fact, on a scale of Brown Band to a lot of money, the Harvard Band reaches a
whopping eleven! Here are some that the Harvard Band can purchase with their
vast quantities of dolla dolla billz y&apos;all!
<br><br>
a. A private jet made of unobtanium.<br>
b. A sophisticated security system to protect their abnormally large drum.<br>
c. A second Harvard Band to go to things the real band doesn&apos;t feel like
attending.<br>
d. More money.<br>
e. The Federal Reserve, and<br>
f. THE PRINCETON BAND<br>
</p>

<p><i>Band forms Bling and plays &ldquo;Dynamite to Rob Harvard&apos;s Bank.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>But enough about our abject poverty. Here&apos;s what Brown&apos;s Department of
Archaeology did over the summer: found water on the moon for the eighth time,
found Waldo and Amelia Earhart and Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper and Balloon Boy
and Bobby Fisher, found Atlantis, found the Ark of the Covenant, found themselves,
found the Holy Grail, and they also killed Nazis.
Oh, here&apos;s what our best friends at Yale University did over the summer:
figured out how to revive aging brains and make them more youthful, and
discovered new clues to the genetic roots of autism.
And here&apos;s what Harvard did over the summer: realized that drinking water
instead of sugary sodas increases weight loss in children! We heard that next on
their agenda is proving that water is wet and fire is hot! Keep up the good work,
boys! Watch now as the band plays &ldquo;Come On, Harvard!&rdquo; and forms a soda bottle
angrily pointing at the Harvard band.</p>

<p><i>Band forms an angry soda bottle and plays &ldquo;Come On, Harvard!&rdquo; (Come on Eileen)</i></p>

<p>As we begin at Harvard, we commit to upholding the values of the College and to
making the entryway and Yard a place where all can thrive and where the exercise
of kindness holds a place on a par with intellectual attainment. SEXUALLY.</p>

<p><i>Band forms a B and plays &ldquo;For Bruno and For Brown.&rdquo;</i></p>

<h2>Brown (35) vs. URI (21)</h2>
<div class="odd"><h3>Pregame</h3>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that still hasn&apos;t figured out what URI stands for, it&apos;s the Brown University &ldquo;Thank You, Disambiguation Page,&rdquo; BAAAANNNNNDDDDDD!</p>

<p>This year, when we heard that we were playing URI, we weren&apos;t quite sure what our athletic department was talking about. So, we turned to our trusted friend Wikipedia and found some interesting answers. Tonight is a faceoff between Bruno and the Fightin&apos; Armenian Cucumbers! Or, maybe we&apos;re playing against a political party in South Korea. Oh no! We all just caught upper respiratory tract infections! Hang on, these all seem false... Did any of these have citations?</p>

<p><i>Band forms a bell curve and plays &ldquo;Tear the Roof Off the Sucker.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>We&apos;re sure that you are all well aware of the bitter rivalry between URI and Brown&ndash;we fight to the death every year for the possession of the prized Governor&apos;s Cup. Little did you know, however, that there are some prizes that are way more exciting than a simple Cup. They are...
<br><br>
a. The Jeweled Shillelagh<br>
b. The Keg of Nails<br>
c. The Slab of Bacon<br>
d. The Old Mountain Jug<br>
e. The Iron Skillet, and<br>
f. THE PRINCETON BAND<br>
</p>

<p>And now, for something completely different, watch as the Band forms a B and plays &ldquo;In the Fray!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that after 87 years has yet to attain tenure, it&apos;s the Brown University &ldquo;Our Research Didn&apos;t Get Funded!!!&rdquo; BAAAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDD!</p>

<p>Welcome to Brown University, a school with a faculty as diverse as its student body! When walking around campus, you&apos;ll see all types of professors&ndash;your Engineering Bros rockin&apos; out to Green&apos;s Theorem, the Medieval Studies LARPers working studiously on their ComicCon costumes, some COE Jocks tossin&apos; around the ol&apos; pigskin, the MCM Hipsters having a glare-off with the VISA Hipsters through their black-rimmed glasses (though we all know LitArts is the most hipster of them all)...Yeah, we know it seems like a lot, but, as with everything else here, being a professor is a spectrum!</p>

<p><i>Band forms hipster glasses and plays &ldquo;Johnny B. Goode.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Our beloved faculty gave us waaayyy too much homework for us to actually write a whole script, so we decided the second halftime paragraph would take the fall. Watch as the band stops writing its CompLit essay, thinks fondly about the free time it once had, and plays &ldquo;I Want You Back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Band forms the Brown logo and plays &ldquo;I Want You Back.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>And now, the band would like to recognize everyone&apos;s favorite University President, Dr. Ruth Simmons. Ruth Simmons can win a game of chess by saying &ldquo;Yahtzee.&rdquo; Did you know Ruth Simmons had a role in Star Wars? She was the Force. When Ruth Simmons rides into the sunset, the sun is actually running from her. Some magicians can walk on water; Ruth Simmons can swim through land. Ruth Simmons rides a Brown Bear being pulled by another Brown Bear to work every day. And, lastly, Ruth Simmons has served the Universtiy for eleven years, leading us to glory for all of them. So thank you, President Simmons, for enriching our lives as Brown students and for everything you&apos;ve contributed to Brown as a university!</p>

<p><i>Band forms a B and plays &ldquo;Brown Three-evermore.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Seriously, we can&apos;t stress enough how great all of our faculty and staff are, and especially how lucky we&apos;ve been to have Ruth Simmons as our president. Oh, URI, are you guys still here? We forgot about you in our Brunonian lovefest. Fans, stop by next week as Bruno takes on the Holy Cross Crusaders. 12th century Middle East, here we come!</p>

<h2>Brown (20) vs. Holy Cross (13)</h2>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that&apos;s not observing the Sabbath or Yom Kippur right now, it&apos;s the Brown University &ldquo;I FEEL SO GUILTY&rdquo; BAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDD!!!</p>

<p>I&apos;m sure that you all are aware of what today is—The Holiest of Holies, the Day of Atonement, and no we&apos;re not talking about that movie with Kiera Knightely and James MacAvoy. It&apos;s Yom Kippur! And for those of you who aren&apos;t Jewish, it&apos;s Fall Weekend! We&apos;re that at this very moment, countless Brown students are either fasting or enjoying their long weekend, and we wish we could be, too! But, instead, we&apos;re here, serving you noble footballgoers as is our traditional Saturday custom. And y&apos;all better feel honored; we&apos;re missing some important business to be here! Seriously—the UN&apos;s Security Council called, and it&apos;s wondering why we&apos;re not at the top-secret summit right now. Oops, that was supposed to be confidential. Hang on, United Nations, we&apos;re on our way!</p>

<p><i>Band forms Math Blaster and plays &ldquo;Hold On, I&apos;m Comin&apos;!&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>And now for something completely different, Storytime with Andrew Leber. *in a Christopher Walken voice* Call me Ishmael. In a sense, I am Jacob Horner. Many years later, as I faced the firing squad, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was a bright, cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.  The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel. It was like so, but wasn&apos;t. It was the day my grandmother exploded. All this happened, more or less. This is the saddest story I have ever heard.</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization ranks itself number one in every survey ever taken, it&apos;s the Brown University &ldquo;Customer Satisfaction Guaranteed&rdquo; BAAAAANNNNNDDDD!</p>

<p>Holy Cross is a fine, upstanding university, and apparently it&apos;s ranked among U.S. News&apos; &ldquo;Alumni&apos;s Top 10 Most Loved Schools,&rdquo; so we did some research regarding their alumni. We found out that Jon Favreau, the director of everyone&apos;s favorite movies, Iron Man and Cowboys and Aliens, and the voice behind everyone&apos;s favorite guinea pig from the spy action thriller G-Force, Hurley the Guinea Pig, is a Holy Cross alum! Isn&apos;t that cool? *pause* Oh, wait, I have just been informed that the famous Hollywood Jon Favreau is actually not a Holy Cross alum; that one is Jon Favreau, President Obama&apos;s speechwriter. Another famous Holy Cross alum is Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, notable for *tongue clicks* being a Supreme Court Justice. Watch now as the band forms a gavel, seriously, it&apos;s a gavel, and plays &ldquo;Beat It.&rdquo;

<p><i>Band forms a gavel and plays &ldquo;Beat It.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>By the way, who knows what&apos;s going on with Via Via IV? When I was here as a freshman, everyone knew that Via Via IV was owned by the &ldquo;Providence Neighborhood Association.&rdquo; Then, I went away to Egypt and came back, and now it&apos;s Cosa Nostra, owned by Italians but run by Egyptians. Then I go away again for the some and now it&apos;s run by Syrians leasing from Egyptians but running it as a Middle Eastern joint called Prince. And then I go back and the Syrians have been evicted by the Egyptians for theft and now it&apos;s back to the way it was? Does anyone even go there? Am I really the only person who buys the pizza? It&apos;s good!</p>

<p><i>Band forms a slice of mushroom pizza and plays &ldquo;Any Way You Want It.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>In case you hadn&apos;t noticed, this weekend is Fall Weekend here at Brown. So, in order to celebrate things that aren&apos;t Christopher Columbus, here&apos;s what you should be doing with your day off from classes:
<br><br>
a. Look at beautiful New England Foliage<br>
b. Jump in a pile of beautiful New England Foliage<br>
c. Burn a whole bunch of New England Foliage<br>
d. Travel back in time and accidentally kill a butterfly, thus causing the disappearance of all New England Foliage<br>
e. Build an army of robots out of New England Foliage to help you take over the world, and<br> 
f. THE NEW ENGLAND FOLIAGE BAND<br>

<p><i>Band forms a B and plays &ldquo;Bring the Victory.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Join us next week as everyone and their grandmother descend upon Brown&apos;s campus—literally!—for family weekend. Spoiler alert, it&apos;s also homecoming! Be prepared to flaunt your Brown spirit as the Bears take on the Tigers, and no, don&apos;t try to make the Wizard of Oz joke, we&apos;ve heard it before.</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that&apos;s taking the Hobbits to Isengard, it&apos;s the Brown University &ldquo;YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!!&rdquo; BBBAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDD!</p>	

<p>A long time ago, in an Earth Middle, Middle Away…</p>

<p>The story takes place in the context of historical events in North-West Middle-earth.  The South of Middle-earth, on the other hand, was enjoying an era of relative peace and prosperity.  The novel begins in Western Massachusetts, as Brodo Baggins inherits the Ring from Gbagbo, recently deposed leader of the Shivory Coast. Both are unaware of its origin, but Wayne Gretzky, a wizard and former hockey coach of Gbagbo, learns of the Ring's history and advises Brodo to take it away from the Shire. Brodo leaves, taking his French maid and friend, Samwise (&quot;Sam&quot;) Gamgee, and two concubines, Meriadoc (&quot;Macho Man&quot;) Brandybuck and Peregrin (&quot;Soulja Boy&quot;) Took, as companions.</p>

<p><i>Band forms the Eye of Sauron and plays &ldquo;Bad Romance.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Fast forwarding enough, but not fast enough that we miss the death of Sean Bean, Adrien Brody suddenly appears, struggles with Brodo for the Ring and bites off Brodo's finger, Ring and all. However in doing so he falls into the fire, taking the Ring with him, and the One Ring is thus destroyed. In the instant of its destruction, Sauron perishes, there is a sexy party, and everyone goes to Vegas.  The end.</p>

<p>Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Giant Flying Eagles have been made for radio, theatre, and film.</p>

<p>While doing some research on the history of Princeton University, the Brown Band discovered a class of stars greater than any other class to ever pass through the halls of the disgustingly endearing Nassau Coliseum. The Princeton Class of Aught&apos;Seven contained such fine gentlemen as Carlton, Dr. Manhattan, Jack Donaghy, Bruce Wayne, Doogie Hauser, M.D., Fred Flintstone, and eight of the nine Nazgul. They wanted to join a fraternity, but Princeton University just disbanded all of them! Thank god the all-inclusive Eating Clubs are still around. Oh, wait…</p>

<p>By the way, welcome friends and family to Family Weekend 2011! Because students from ninety-three countries attend Brown University, the Office of Student Life contracted us to translate the phrase &ldquo;Family Weekend&rdquo; for all of our brethren from abroad.

<p>Oh well, at least the Band has chicken. Speaking of chicken, established in 1924, the Brown University Band is one of Brown's oldest and most unique student organizations. Founded by Irving Harris, the band has successfully brought Brown's distinct tradition and music to every student that has walked through the Van Wickle Gates. In addition, the band continues to provide alumni with memories of their days at Brown. With an audience ranging from children to adults, the band manages to capture a smile from all while performing a wide variety of music. From athletic events to commencement ceremonies to the world's only ice skating band, the Brown University Band is the spirit of Brown.</p>
