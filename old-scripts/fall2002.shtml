<h2>Harvard: </h2>
<p><b>[pregame]</b> Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an 
organization that has the<br>
freedom to get an Sc.B. in puppies and flowers, it's the Brown University &quot;We're 
putting the 'S'<br>
back in S/NC&quot; BAND!!!<br>
<br>
The reputation of Harvard University, one of the finest educational institutions 
in Muskatine<br>
county, Iowa, was besmirched last year by accusations of rampant grade 
inflation. In a controversial<br>
move, Harvard responded by replacing beloved Assistant Provost Henry Winkler 
with the world's<br>
foremost authority on corrective alphabetics, Texas Instruments' Speak and 
Spell. The Brown Band<br>
salutes the heroes who, despite all odds, have struggled to bring down Harvard's 
overall GPA with<br>
the theme to NFL on Fox.<br>
<br>

<br>
Harvard students, who characteristically never think about their college's 
reputation, are now<br>
trying anything to keep their academic performance well beneath their 
professors' already low<br>
expectations. Students have been seen vigorously quaffing brain-cell killing 
beverages such Charles<br>
River Water Classic, Diet Charles River Water (same great bacteria, just one 
calorie), Vanilla<br>
Charles River Water, and Pepsi Blue. The Brown Band, ever the clairvoyant, will 
predict Harvard<br>
students' future grades to the tune of Brown Cheering Song.<br>

<b>[halftime]</b> Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an 
organization whose sandals have<br>
been sticking to the floors of the showers in Keeney, it's the Brown University 
&quot;my drain is clogged<br>
with WHAT???&quot; BAND!!!<br>
<br>
The Brown Band welcomes the class of 2006, and it is always a joy for us to see 
wide-eyed freshman<br>
discover the marvels of college life — such as a cappella arch sings or Ratty 
breakfasts — that<br>
we've long since stopped caring about. Why, they're so cute and innocent, 
whether packed together<br>
in the lounges on Wriston or sleeping over with their unit at health services 
afterwards, that we<br>
just want to boil them water and bake them brownies. Watch now as everyone is 
out to get the band<br>
and we resolve to find the weasel who snagged our Doritos.<br>
<br>
[band forms an eye for looking and plays &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;]<br>
<br>
One thing you can say about this year's freshman class is that they sure do love 
stairs. Why, all<br>
day long they just go down like an alternative energy activist protesting 
elevators. Still, if they<br>
spend all their time on the stairs and not at the Rock, their grades will go 
down like an alternator<br>
dropped from the roof of a building, an event that, in history, will surely go 
down like an<br>
altercation between a samurai and a convenience store clerk. Watch now as the 
band clears its throat<br>
and stands up to play &quot;Speak Up Mambo.&quot;<br>
<br>
[band forms a smile and plays &quot;Speak Up Mambo&quot;]<br>
<br>
A surprising trend has freshman forgoing traditional UFS employment for more 
esoteric means of<br>
making money. From TAing grad seminars in engineering socioneurotics to selling 
fake IDs to the<br>
Savage Patch kids, why, there's no end to their fiscal ingenuity. 
Image-conscious Thayer St. bikers<br>
have even been hiring freshman as runners to buy the falafel wraps, Beck albums, 
and loose fit<br>
hipster khakis that they're too afraid to purchase in person. The Brown Band, 
however, is hoping<br>
that, with a B and a Brown song for our beloved alumni, we'll all see a secure 
future in<br>
Providence's next political machine.<br>
<br>
[band forms B, plays In The Fray]<br>
<br>
Directly following today's game the Band will host a pole-removal clinic for 
Harvard students, and<br>
next week we'll be at URI as the Bears fight the Rams for our Governor's favor.<br>
<br>

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that wants 
to elect Spike for<br>
Governor, it's the Brown University &quot;I accept your engorging hot-dog challenge&quot; 
BAND!!!<br>
<br>
The grim blade of term limits has descended on Rhode Island governor Lincoln 
Almond, finally ending<br>
URI's vice-like grip on state politics. Almond says he looks forward to 
retirement, which he will<br>
use to spend time with his family, polish his tusks, and eat Providence. The 
Band, divided between<br>
its school loyalty for Republican Don Carcieri and its social conscience for 
Democrat Myrth &quot;This<br>
Time For Sure&quot; York, will remember that we're not even registered to vote here 
anyway and play ...<br>
<br>
[band forms a football]<br>
<br>
But we rejoice because the favored candidate for the real capo de tuti capi of 
Rhode Island, the<br>
Providence mayor, is Brown's own David Cicilline, a man personally diverse 
enough to appeal to<br>
everyone except Providence's significant Inuit vote. If Cicilline is elected, 
we'll look forward to<br>
city council meetings out on the green during sunny days, the de-armament of the 
Providence Police,<br>
and drum circles, drum circles, drum circles. The Band welcomes this bright 
future with ...<br>

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that's not 
afraid to construct<br>
distractions on the side of major highways, it's the &quot;Nibbles WHAT??? Away&quot; Big 
Blue Bug Band!<br>
<br>
Recent surveys of Rhode Island residents have shown that termites, even colossal 
cerulean ones,<br>
simply aren't being perceived as terrifying pests anymore. Other vermin, like 
the silverfish, the<br>
Egyptian mosquito, the syphilitic plague-ridden monkey, the rust-proof mongoose, 
Cranston, the ewok,<br>
or the lesser-horned ram are instilling more fear than the common termite ever 
has. New England Pest<br>
Control is going so far as to consider replacing its iconic mascot with a more 
despicable pest, a 9<br>
foot tall Joe Mollicone.<br>
<br>
[band forms stick figure]<br>
<br>
As the self-appointed big blue keepers of the big blue faith, the Big Blue Bug 
Band has vowed to<br>
raise awareness of the big blue danger posed by big blue bugs and ensure their 
position as the<br>
premier big blue symbol of peskiness in this little blue state. Big blue bugs 
will blot out the<br>
sun! Big blue bugs will destroy Rhode Island's maranara sauce reserves! Big blue 
bugs will close the<br>
University Club until we get our way! The Big Blue Bug Band will now eat the 
forest for the wood and<br>
play ...<br>
<br>
[band forms tree]<br>
<br>
Still, Brown students at heart, we're hoping for a resolution born of peaceful 
demonstrations,<br>
colloquiums, and sparsely-attended community discussions. Because, in the end, 
isn't there a little<br>
big blue bug in all of us? Actually, there will be, because today we're 
announcing a program of<br>
implanting big blue bug larva in suitable hosts across the state, starting with 
the Governor's Cup<br>
and moving on to his chin. Capping off its most alliterative show yet, the Big 
Blue Bug Band will<br>
form a B and play ...<br>
<br>

Next week the Bears will battle more Rams at Fordham, but the band, 
self-important little creatures<br>
that we are, will wisely stay home.<br>

<p><b>[pregame]</b> Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni! Presenting an 
organization that will live to see another<br>
sunrise, it's the Brown University &quot;Forrester? I hardly know her&quot; BAND!!!<br>
<br>
Not to be outdone by rival small state Rhode Island's alleged mayoral 
corruption, New Jersey has<br>
cooked up a political scandal of its own as Democrats replaced ethically quirky 
Senate candidate<br>
Robert Torricelli with aging hipster Frank Lautenberg. As Brown students, we 
stand in solidarity<br>
with the state Supreme Court's decision that deadlines don't mean anything 
anyhow, and we're<br>
overjoyed to see a Supreme Court that doesn't throw an election to an ignorant, 
unqualified smirk.<br>
The Brown Band will now form an object leathery as Lautenberg's skin and play 
&quot;NFL on Fox&quot;<br>
<br>
Republican challenger Doug Forrester, meanwhile, is faced with having to reprint 
thousands of signs<br>
and leaflets bearing his &quot;Doug Forrester is not Robert Torricelli&quot; campaign 
slogan. Speculations<br>
about his new slogan have been running wild: &quot;Vote Forrester, Because Frank 
Lautenberg Is Just<br>
Robert Torricelli In An Old Guy Mask,&quot; or &quot;Doug Forrester: He Can Cut Medicare 
Because He Doesn't<br>
Need It.&quot; The Band is confident that, if elected, Doug Forrester will be able to 
do for New Jersey<br>
what the Boss did for Asbury Park. With a B for Bruuuuuuuce, the we'll play 
&quot;Brown Cheering Song&quot;<br>

<b>[halftime]</b> Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and freakishly plaid 
little creatures, presenting an<br>
organization that's waiting for its Nobel Prize in Puppies and Flowers, it's the 
Brown University<br>
&quot;Sweeden? I hardly... no wait that doesn't really work&quot; BAND!!!<br>
<br>
The Brown Band congratulates Princeton professor Daniel Kahneman for his recent 
Nobel Prize in<br>
Economics. Kahneman's groundbreaking insight was that humans are not rational, 
calculating, or<br>
self-interested in their economic dealings, but instead brutish, indiscriminate, 
and, on occasion,<br>
ugly. His theories will go far in explaining public acceptance of such perverse 
economic spectacles<br>
as instant-win lottery games, energy futures, and the privatization of social 
security. The band<br>
will search out the prime motivator in economics and play &quot;Karn Evil 9.&quot;<br>
<br>
[band forms magnifying glass]<br>
<br>
Having all taken Intro to Psych our freshman years (pass/fail, of course), the 
Brown Band is well<br>
versed in the psychology that Kahneman was able to apply to economics, even if 
we spent most of the<br>
time trying to flatten squirrels with our copies of Freud's Interpretation of 
Dreams. But we still<br>
know all about the human behaviors Kahneman studied, such as the playing of 
sports without clothes,<br>
the needing to know what students who applied to Princeton were also accepted by 
Seton Hall, and the<br>
constant oppression of the underclass. Content to just imitate University 
buildings, the band will<br>
give a nod to the best thing to come out of New Jersey since Brown, and play 
&quot;Born To Run.&quot;<br>
<br>
[band forms university hall, ie; some boxy building thing]<br>
<br>
This great nation seems to be barreling into a recession, and Princeton students 
are being hit the<br>
hardest of any. Besides eliminating all remaining left hand turns in the town, 
what else can<br>
Princeton cut from its budget to maintain its already frugal standard of living? 
How about:<br>
<br>
A) Kevin Mitnick<br>
<br>
B) Eating clubs' weekly eating out sessions<br>
<br>
C) Reparations<br>
<br>
D) Subsidies for orange-colored restaurants specializing in chicken wings and 
tight clothing<br>
<br>
E) Professors stolen from other Ivy League universities<br>
<br>
F) The Princeton Band<br>
<br>
Watch as the combined might of the Brown Band chooses an answer and plays &quot;Brown 
Man Born&quot;<br>

<br>
Today both teams are looking for their first Ivy victory, but the Brown Band is 
confident in the<br>
Bears because our parents beat Cornell ten years ago, though we're unsure about 
what equipment the<br>
chief Axis of Aggie has acquired since then. But given that a good offense is 
the best defense,<br>
especially when it's dangerously maverick and thoroughly unprovoked, we think 
we're in a good<br>
position to uphold the family name and achieve regime &quot;Championship.&quot;<br>
<br>
[band forms football and plays &quot;Championship&quot;]<br>
<br>
Cornell, for its part, has been trying to avoid this game at all costs, going so 
far as to pull out<br>
of Quatar, where it has been occupying a medical school, and releasing all its 
captive livestock<br>
from their pens. But not even the recent revelation that Johnson and Wales 
University has secretly<br>
developed its own football program will keep the Bears from taking the field. 
The Brown Band, which<br>
always prefers forming B on the field to trading its life for fossil fuels on 
foreign soil, will<br>
welcome today's relatively peaceful impending conflict with...<br>
<br>

It's Parents' Weekend again, when our parents take time off from following the 
Korn and Disturbed<br>
tour around the country, stop renting out our old rooms to railway hobos who 
creepily resemble us,<br>
and join us here on College Hill for a weekend of shared college experiences. 
Why, they haven't<br>
been here 24 hours and already they've held a toga sock-hop, constructed Pong on 
the SciLi, and<br>
bought the first three Belle and Sebastian albums. But why shouldn't they be 
comfortable here? The<br>
way things are today a draft card is all that separates us from 1964 anyway. So, 
with that in mind,<br>
the band, and its parents, will remember the long-haired glory days of past and 
present and play...<br>
<br>
[band forms peace symbol]<br>
<br>
Parents' Weekend is also a time to show our parents where their hard-earned 
tuition money has been<br>
going. While in years past it's been used for everything from endowment-building 
at Newport Grand<br>
Jai Alai to helping empty out dead Nigerian dictators' bank accounts, this year 
the corporation has<br>
picked much more sensible goals: fuzzy dice in every shuttle, a Roman citizen on 
every green, and a<br>
Nerf bow and arrow set for every BUP. The band is especially excited about the 
new monthly schedule<br>
for flushing dirt and grime from campus facilities. Always happy to get the 
blood flowing, the band<br>
will clean out the new Thomas Watson International Studies building to the tune 
of...<br>
<br>

Active little self-important creatures that we are, Brown students have been 
starting hundreds of<br>
new organizations that are eager to put together informational programs for 
parents. Today look for<br>
presentations by the Boston Celtics Society, The Samurai Anti-Defamation League, 
Brown ROTC, The<br>
Brown Young Know-Nothings, Brown Yatzee, Club Field Tennis, and Okay, Maybe One 
Or Two Victims<br>
Somewhere, Just As Long As It's One Of Those Former Soviet Union Countries Whose 
Name I Can't<br>
Pronounce Anyway. But remembering that there's no replacement for the Brown 
Band, the Band will make<br>
a B for itself and its parents and play...<br>
<br>

Next week the Brown Band, armed with bagels and a hankering for wholesome 
breakfasts, will take to<br>
the streets of Philadelphia and demand lower cholesterol and those nifty 
wide-brimmed hats.<br>
