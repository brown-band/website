<div class="odd"><h2>Quinnipiac</h2>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization that was recently voted best scramble band in America in the most recent Quinnipiac poll, it.s the Brown University .Blitz the Pitz? How .bout Mayhem in Meehan?!!. BAND!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Well, it certainly has been a long winter break.  The band spent its month at home rather uneventfully, mostly playing their new Nintendo Wii and waiting to come back to campus.  Many Brown students returned to campus, anxiously awaiting the addition of the new Friedman Study Center in the Scili.  The all night hours of this new facility will now allow some students the solution they have been waiting for to lose an undesirable roommate: between the shower in the CIT and the Friedman Center, students will never have to go to their rooms.  Watch now as the band expresses the hours at which most of its members cram, I mean study, forms the SciLi and plays .Midnight Special.</p>

<p>At the Grand Opening party for the center, the band was intrigued by the ambiguous decibel signs that hang in the new Scili basement.  We considered heading down there to display our version of 50 decibels.  But instead we thought that the flutes would do a better job of going in there and demonstrating zero decibels, because most of us have lost the frequency they play on.  Watch now as the band demonstrates this phenomenon while forming a zero and playing .You Can Call Me Al..  You seriously can.t hear the flutes!</p>

<p><em>Band forms a zero, plays .You Can Call Me Al.</em></p>

<p>But enough about renovations around campus; nothing gets the band as excited as a counterskate.  No telling if .The Best Ice Skating Band in the Land. will successfully complete this extremely dangerous formation, and each time it is attempted is a completely different experience.  Look over there- I think they are about to attempt one now!  Watch as the band performs this mythical maneuver while playing .In the Fray..</p>

<p><em>counterskate, .In the Fray.</em></p>

<p>The band looks forward to the plethora of upcoming hockey and basketball games this break as much as John Kerry is looking forward to the upcoming Presidential elections.  Oh, no, I.ve botched the joke, I.m so sorry, oh man I feel so bad- goodbye cruel public!</p></div>

<div class="even"><h2>Harvard</h2>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization that is still in awe of the Canadian Parliamentary system, it.s the Brown University .Power Street? I hardly know.er street!. BAND!!!</p>

<p>The band always relishes the opportunity to meet the Crimson on the field of athletic competition.  A color is always bound to put up a good fight against a bear.yea.  Speaking of Larry Summers, the band was pleasantly surprised to read this past week that the new president of Harvard is going to be a woman by the name of Drew G. Faust.  We applaud Harvard for this forward thinking decision.  When nobody else was bold enough to appoint a woman president, the shining beacon of American higher education rose to the challenge and showed us that a woman can be the president of an Ivy League school.  O wait, that wasn.t you guys, was it?  At last count, didn.t Brown and Princeton both already have women presidents?  Yea that.s right.  Watch now as the band forms a female and explains how happy we are that Ruth is not going from us to them.</p>

<p><em>band forms female, plays .From me to You.</em></p>

<p>When Ruth was quoted expressing her lack of interest for the Harvard job, the band was elated.  Just in case she was thinking about jumping ship, we made a list of reasons why Brown is a better school to be the president of:</p>
<p>A.  Cross registration at RISD-  It was the number one factor in my decision to come here</p>
<p>B.  National media coverage on .The O.Reilly Factor..</p>
<p>C.  Nothing at Harvard.s late night eateries can compare to the Chicken Carb.</p>
<p>D.  Strong programs for women in the sciences.</p>
<p>E.  Ruth, we love you so much, we know it.s a little late, but will you be our Valentine?</p>
<p>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!!</p>

<p>Showing true love for our president, the band will now form a heart and play .Gimme Some Lovin..</p>

<p><em>band forms heart, plays .Gimme Some Lovin..</em></p>

<p>For our final act tonight, the band will once again grace all of you fine people with our performance of the daring, dastardly, and, if I do say so myself, debonair, COUNTERSKATE!  We.ve been practicing a lot since the last time we did this, but it is doubtful that there will be any noticeable change.  Its ok though, we just changed the grade option on ice shows to S/NC.  Watch now as the band enters No Work City and counterskates while playing .In the Fray..</p>

<p><em>counterskate, .In the Fray.</em></p>

<p>Thanks for coming out tonight, kiddies.  This is our last ice show for the year, but look for us around campus this spring.  And if you ever need us, you know who to call...the A Team!</p></div>
