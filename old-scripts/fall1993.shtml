      As many of you may have heard, the highly respected National Review
      College Guide recently rated Brown as being at 'the forefront of the
      dissolution of academic standards'. Other schools such as Yale, Harvard,
      Stanford, and Dartmouth were also listed as being representative of the
      'deplorable state of higher education in America today.' Well, yet another
      college review that puts Yale second. At Brown we wear Bill Buckley's
      scorn like a badge of honor. And as for all the faithful readers who rely
      on the National Review for their college decisions, we heard they're both
      going to Providence College.

      Ah New Haven. If there's one thing we sure do envy about Yale, it's your
      prime location. The job market here is incredible! You Yalies are almost
      assured of finding jobs after graduation, what with the World Wrestling
      Federation headquartered so close by. And men, don't think this doesn't
      apply to you too! Unfortunately, it seems that the real estate market here
      is somewhat depressed. Apparently a large institution of higher education,
      frequently ranked second in the nation, has been selling off its property
      and inundating the market. In fact, we noticed that the roadside rest stop
      was offering a special package: get a piece of the Berlin Wall and a piece
      of Yale for just $5. Needless to say we spent our money on fries instead.

      We in the Brown Band would like to be the first to congratulate Yale on
      their selection of a new President. In order to be certain the President
      would not jump ship when a better offer came along, the search committee
      had to make sure that their candidate wasn't qualified for any higher
      paying jobs. As a service to the search committee, we've compiled a list
      of the top 5 jobs for which Yale President's are qualified.

      Students returned to College Hill this semester to find a number of
      changes around campus. French fries at Josiah's doubled in price to 30
      cents an ounce, apparently in an effort to jump start the faltering
      Campaign for the Rising Generation. Police and Security announced a zero
      tolerance fire alarm policy with fines starting at $10 for students living
      in buildings where false alarms are pulled, also apparently an effort to
      jump start the Capital Campaign. Finally, the Ratty implemented a new
      boxless cereal distribution system, causing a drop in applications to URI
      and a drop in campus literacy in general.

      initiative to the nation recently. Harvard Law reported a subsequent rise
      in applications from former PLME's. The North American Free Trade
      Agreement will be debated in Congress soon, with the main issue being the
      possible loss of low skilled American jobs. Professors at URI are already

      As many of you know, Brown was the proud host of First Lady Hillary
      Clinton this week. A hot issue around campus was the restricted admission.
      Only certain invited groups were allowed to attend. The College
      Republicans were not originally on the &quot;in&quot; list, but
      fortunately extra seats were found in the back for both of them. After the
      televised discussion ended, Mrs. Clinton visited Andrews House, home of
      Brown's own Health Services. After waiting in line for an hour an half,
      Hillary was given some hot chicken soup by a nurse and told to go home.

      Brown parents can often feel out of touch with their children, and
      sometimes communication between Brown students and their parents is

      to understand what your Brown student is telling you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="justify">
          If your student spends time at the Underground, that's OK. If your
          student spends time at underground tunnel parties, you should be
          somewhat concerned.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p align="justify">
          If your student studies in the CIT or the Rock, that's OK. If your
          student sits in The Gate and plays with rocks, you've got a problem.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p align="justify">
          If your student has classes during B and H hours, that's OK. If your
          student has classes in B&amp;H, that's still OK. But if your students
          reads the BDH, you should seek help.

      Parents worried about the safety of their child should rest assured that
      Brown has numerous programs geared toward safeguarding the well-being of
      its students. The Brown Escort Service is not only free, but takes extra
      steps to guarantee your student the best protection possible. The same
      applies to Health Services. Brown Police Officers, though armed only with
      a smile and a donut, maintain a visible presence on campus, deterring
      would-be criminals and marauding Harvard students. In fact the Brown
      campus is so safe that a recent Office of Risk Management study concluded
      that the only real threats to student's well-being are UFS theme nights.

      being accepted to Penn, I am enclosing a double-headed quarter to aid the
      Admissions Office with their final decision. And if that doesn't work,
      then I can always bribe someone. I should have no trouble getting in
      however, because unlike most Penn applicants, I was able to check the
      &quot;can tie own shoes&quot; box on my application.

      Welcome to the University of Pennsylvania's annual Parent's Weekend. We'd
      like to reassure those parents worried about their safety while on campus
      that, despite Philadelphia's reputation, the chances of being mugged are
      no greater than the chances of being attacked by a water buffalo.
      Furthermore, the University has formed a special Committee for Water
      Buffalo Safety to increase campus water buffalo safety awareness. Besides,
      most of the dangerous water buffalo have left Philadelphia and now live in
      Washington at the National Endowment for the Humanities.

      arrived in Ithaca. &quot;Having thoroughly lost my way to Florida, I've
      given up and decided to found my university here in Ithaca. While Ithaca
      doesn't have the sun, beaches, and tennis facilities that Florida has, the
      area is gorge-ous and will surely provide future students with places to
      relax and dive into their studies. I must confess, Ithaca is not the ideal
      location for a university. But someday this backwards rural village will
      become a bustling metropolis and the pinnacle of higher education in
      America - (pause) - or maybe not.&quot;

      the following four people have in common: Ba Ba Blacksheep, Mary, Little
      Bo Peep, and Little Boy Blue? Besides the obvious fact that they're all
      Dartmouth alums, they're now all employed in Dartmouth's Job Placement

      And now for some more sheep jokes. First we'd like to warn all Dartmouth
      students that wool shrinks when it gets wet. Or in other words, wool
      causes shrinkage. So be careful with your sheepskins. Speaking of sheep,
      we thought we should let you know that your ugly, slobbering, sheep-like
      mascot is good for one thing and one thing only, and it ain't lamb chops.
      If you think your mascot intimidates opponents, then someone is pulling
      the wool over your eyes.

      especially during shearing season when love is in the air. Such romantic
      settings are hard to come by in the urban sprawl of Providence. But in
      Hanover, with its abundant grazing land, love is as common as the
      contented ba-ah of a sheep on a summer day.

      Before reviewing these events, we'd like to apologize for the fire in the
      Stuart Theatre. We told the guy over and over again &quot;The Ratty, The
      Ratty,&quot; but apparently he misunderstood. Video games and a jukebox
      were recently added to Josiah's. Future UFS plans call for a hot tub in
      The Gate and bumper cars in the Ivy Room. All proceeds go toward improving
      the selection of the vegan bar at the Ratty. Popular alternative band
      Belly recently cancelled their BCA-Alumnae Hall show in favor of a WBRU-FM
      sponsored concert. Apparently impressed with general manager Jason
      Bordoff's ability to outrage and anger the Brown community, the Film
