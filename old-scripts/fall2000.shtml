Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni - presenting the only campus

Organization, it's the Brown - University - BAND!

      </p>
      <p><b>[Band runs onto field]</b></p>
      <p>
Exciting news, band!  Today, our football team will be playing against USD.
Do you know where that is, Band?  That's right, California.  And do you 
know what California has that we don't?  California girls. Maybe that's 
why Men's Health considers us so anti-male.  Watch now as the band 
forms the football of love and expresses its desire for the women of the west 
coast.
</p>
      <p><b>[Band plays &quot;Everyone Needs Somebody To 
Love&quot;]</b>
<p>So, band, where is California?  (dramatic pause) Um, I don't know either.
OK, so the band may not know as much about geography as, say, a USD 
student.  But at least we don't have to go to school in sunny Southern 
California.  We get  cold, rainy, humid, sweltering, miserable, divine 
Providence 10 months out of the year.  Bet that makes you jealous, huh?  
Watch now as the band forms a B for bad weather and plays &quot;bring the 
geography.&quot;  <p><b>[Band does this]</b></p>

<p>Thank you all for being here for USD's last appearance here before 
California breaks off and sinks into the ocean.  Join us in honoring 
the continental 48 -- soon to be 47 -- states (and Alaska and Hawaii, 
too.)  Please rise for the National Anthem.

     <p><b>[Band runneth onto the field]</b></p>
      <p>Welcome back alumni for that great event we call homecoming.  
The highlight of this for many is watching the Brown team take on the Harvard team.  
Brains being better than brawn, of course, we usually win.</p>
      <p><b>[Band plays &quot;Championship&quot;]</b></p>
      <p>Recently, Harvard and Brown have instituted a dual early 
action program that enables students to apply to Brown AND Harvard early.  
Supposedly, this will allow students more freedom, and less worries in the 
application process.  However, it is the band's opinion that Harvard just wants 
our applicant pool.  Watch now as the band forms the letter of the
only Ivy League school that matters and plays Brown and only Brown 
Forevermore.</p><p><b>[Band does exactly that]</b>

      <p><b>[Band runs across the field in its oversized sneakers]</b></p>
      <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the Evil Empire (TM) controls 
most of space.
A small band of freedom fighters are surrounded on all sides by the 
forces of Crimson and Navy Blue.  They are the galaxy's last hope against the 
tyranny of unoriginal thought and complacency.  What are their chances?  
Stay tuned to find out.  Watch now as they calculate
their probability of success and play 25 for, 6-to-9 against.
</p><p><b>[Band forms 0, or 1, (or maybe 1/2, etc.), and plays "25 or 6 to

      <p>Desparate, our heroes concoct a daring plan to 
lure the Empire to Brown, where they will
destroy the forces of darkness entirely.  As they lay their trap, one of 
the warriors is
caught off guard by a suprise attack and is captured.  Ever defiant, the 
student bravely
holds out against all forms of torture -  being forced to listen to tapes 
of old Al Gore
speeches, wear crimson, and hear whiny Harvard students complain all 
day.  Will he break?
Stay tuned to find out!
</p>
      <p><b>[Band forms question mark, plays &quot;Think&quot;]</b></p>
      <p>Eventually, however, our brave student can take no more.  Defeated, he 
tells all, under
the condition that the Harvard students (I'm not sure what goes 
here).  The crimson forces,
aware of the trap, attack, hoping for a decisive victory.  Watch now as

      <em><small>Saturday, October 14, 2000</small></em></a></h1>
      <p align="left"><b><i><font size="5">Pregame:</font></i></b></p>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that 
seems to always visit Princeton right after President Clinton, it's the 
Brown University - why, yes, Mr. President - Band!
</p><p><b>[Band perambulates about the field]</b>
      <p>The timing of Clinton's visit might suggest that he is under consideration 
for the post that President Shapiro will be giving up.  Of course, Clinton 
was discarded early on as a candidate for the Brown Presidency.  Some of 
the reasons: we already have waffles every morning in the dining halls, 
the women of Brown just weren't interested in his internship 
opportunities, and we're running out of jokes about him.
      <p><b>[Band plays &quot;Championship&quot;]</b></p>
      <p>But a Clinton presidency wouldn't be all bad.  He would no doubt bring 
many improvements to the Princton campus: a resurgence in pole dancing - I 
mean, wrestling; he could give saxophone lessons to the Princeton band; 
and 6 to 10 more years of guaranteed bad jokes from the Brown Band.  Watch 
now as the band ponders a second Clinton Presidency, and plays [some Brown song].

University - I tawt i taw a puddy tat - Band!</p>
      <p><b>[Band runs on, does its thing]</b></p>
      <p>When we left you 3 weeks ago, the rumpled and dejected band was huddling 
for survival, while their fearless leader Elrod Snidley was off in 
California being chased by a mob of fast blond women with big cans of 
slim-fast.  Watch now as Elrod and fellow wronged genius Wen Ho Lee leave 
the sunnier climes of the west coast to go undercover at Princeton and 
save the band.
</p>
      <p><b>[Band forms sunglasses, plays "Secret Asian Man"]</b></p>
      <p>Arriving at Princeton, Elrod demanded, "take me to your leader." 
Unfortunately, President Shapiro was not available, as he was meeting with 
the other Ivy League presidents to vote E Gordon Gee off the "college 
edition" of Survivor.  Unfortunately, after also voting off Neil L. 
Rudenstine of Harvard, he found himself next to be kicked out of the ivory 
tower and onto the ivory beaches of some south pacific island.  Watch now 
as the band sends them off to tropical paradise, and plays "Jungle 
Boogie."</p>
      <p><b>[Band forms palm tree, plays &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot;]</b></p>

      <p>Left without other options, Elrod met with Janina Montero and persuaded 
her to join the tide of adminstrators leaving Princeton like rats from a 
sinking ship.  Arriving in Providence, Janina threatened the other Ivy 
League bands: "My name is Janina Montero; You voted my president onto the 
island; Prepare to die."  Will she be able to hold off the uncouth hordes 
of Cornell, Columbia, and Dartmouth students? And what about the dim-witted 
aspiring presidents of Harvard and Yale? Tune in next week to find out!

Fortunately, Brown's committment to liberal learning provides classes to 
help them relax, such as International Relations 13 - picking up Euro

      <p>For those of you who have been following the season we present the next 
chapter of Elrod Snidley's wacky hijinks.  Last week, Elrod, the plucky 
band mascot, and Janina Montero, portrayed by Liz Hurley, left Princeton 
to rescue the Brown Band from their archnemesis, the Cornell Band.  They 
did such a good job that the Cornell Band is in a heap at the bottom of 
the gorge trying out a new formation - the double rotating ah splat.  Our 
heroes found the Brown Band lying on the floor complaining of splitting 
headaches and rubbing their bloodshot eyes.  When asked what they'd been 
doing they claimed that they'd gotten sick from studying too hard.  Of 
course we know that what they told their parents was a Saturday night 
fever was actually a Sunday morning hangover.  Watch now as the band rolls 
its blood shot eye.</p>
      <p><b>[</b><b>Band forms an I and plays "Saturday

      <p>Speaking of bloodshot eyes, I just flew in from 
Thebes and boy do my

But now that the freshmen are on their own they've had to learn how to do 
things for themselves, like cooking, walking, and chewing their own food.

Bush and Gore, the band knows better. Gore, for example, speaks fluent 
English. 
We're not sure what language Bush speaks, but careful analysis has allowed us to 
find etymologies for some items in his vocabulary. "Japanians" seems to be derived 
from the Heiroglyph "Bread-Mouth-Squiggle," which roughly translates to 
"People who are smarter than me." Watch now as the band calls for a 
return to old-time family values. And languages!

won't really tell you how to use your vote. This is America, and you can vote 
for any dumb rich guy you want.  Watch now as the band forms the highest grade

<p>Actually, we anticipate being able to return to the United States within a 
few years.  By that point, global warming will have put Florida under 
several 
feet of ocean.  And just think - by that point the climate will have undergone 
enough change to make Hanover habitable by humans.  Rhode Island might be a 
little wet, but it rains 2 days out of 3 anyway in Providence, so we won't 
notice the difference.
<p><b>[Band forms "B," plays some Brown Song]</b>
<p>Join us next week in the warmer climes of Providence where the Bears will 
be winding down the season against the Lions (oh my!), and the band will 
be bidding adeiu to its graduating seniors.

<p>Our seniors have been here a while,
<br>their memories will give us a smile
<br>their presence we'll miss
<br>as we run down the list
<br>now if we could just get rid of Kyle ...
<br>
<br>Carolyn's our fearless leader
<br>she always is there when you need her
<br>she used to play reeds
<br>but responded to our needs
<br>now her spit valve dumps out a liter
<br>
<br>Our head conductor is Nick
<br>he studies why people get sick
<br>he has quite a knack
<br>for playing the sax
<br>and also for waving his stick
<br>
<br>Josh the corsec once was
<br>he took up a valiant cause
<br>to be drowning in liquor
<br>or watching a stripper
<br>whose weight was against the state laws
<br>
<br>Marty has really red hair
<br>he's loud so you know when he's there
<br>but when playing the flute
<br>you can't hear a toot
<br>so he switched to the trombone last year

<br>Princess Alycia is grand
<br>she holds Mike in the palm of her hand
<br>she directs S and M
<br>she's a dominating femme
<br>when she says attention, you stand!
<br>
<br>Chuck keeps a mighty fine beat
<br>he has trouble with skates on his feet
<br>from old San Antone
<br>he's bad to the bone
<br>he's not gone, he'll be right down the street!
<br>
<br>The low end of the reeds is Veronica
<br>she's more fun than the 8 nights of Chanukah
<br>she comes decked in leather
<br>no matter the weather
<br>this limerick's clean - how ironica!
<br>
<br>There once was a stringbean named Steve
<br>who was so long you wouldn't believe
<br>he rushed the bass drum
<br>and got thrown out on his bum
<br>and came back cause he just wouldn't leave - I mean come!
<br>
<br>Our quad player Brian F. Locke
<br>kept plenty of booze in his stock
<br>he takes lots of chugs
<br>and gives lots of hugs
<br>he's the sketchiest guy on the block
<br>
<br>There once was a sketchball named James
<br>whose girls were too many to name
<br>the trumpet's a ball
<br>but they found it too small
<br>so he picked up the sousaphone in shame
<br>
<br>Jonah McBride is our veep
<br>with the corsec he often does sleep
<br>the child of a stonah
<br>he drinks lots of Corona
<br>and he hasn't showered in a week.
<br>arooooooooo!

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an
organization that's about to lose it's better fourth, it's the Brown
University - shoulda gone with the five-year plan - BAND!
</p>
<p><b>(Band stumbles onto field in the manner of a super-senior heading 
to 9 am class)</b>

<p>All season long we've been following the epic story of the band's hero,
Elrod Snidley.  Originally we planned to end that story in this halftime
show.  Well, it ain't gonna happen.  We pre-empt the season finale to
bring you something with even more intrigue, seduction, and scandal - epic
election coverage!  Watch now as the band tries to prevent a miscarriage
of justice in Florida and forms a metaphor for the state's electoral votes.
</p><p><b>(Band forms a trophy, plays "Smooth")</b></p>
<p>Last week, Brown announced our next president, something that we don't
anticipate the United States managing for another year or so.  To make Dr.
Simmons's transition to Brown as comfortable as possible, the band will now
form a comfortable shoe and play "Play That Funky Music Brown Boys"
<b>(band shouts "and Girls")</b>
</p><p><b>(Band forms shoe, plays "Play That Funky Music Brown 
Boys")</b></p>
<p>
So, to summarize - Brown has a new president, the rest of the country
can't quite figure it out, and Harvard and Princeton can't even 
narrow it
down to two candidates.  And Columbia students?  Well, they were awfully
confused by the SAT's, so filling out a New York ballot was probably far
beyond them - though it is multiple choice.</p>
<p><b>(Band forms "B", plays "Brown Bear")</b></p>
<p>Join us next year, when the Bears take on the University of San Diego on
their home turf, and the band continues to make jokes about the
still-undecided election results.

<p><b>(Band marches off to "Ever True")</b></p>
