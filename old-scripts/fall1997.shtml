    Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, secret society members, and all
    you members of the New Haven Local #369 Papparazzi Trade Union, presenting
    an organization that runs the tightest band in the banding business, it's
    the Brown University 3rd day air track BAND!
  </p>

  <p><strong>[Band strikes out onto field] </strong></p>

  <p>
    The recent opening of a strip club less than a bone's throw away from the
    Yale campus has been the cause of a major uproar. We in the Brown Band,
    however, believe that it should be viewed as a positive thing. Why? Well, it
    gives Yalies plenty of interesting, er, internship opportunities. Not to
    mention that it's certain to increase Yale's national, or at least local,
    exposure. Plus it gives us a chance to get back at you guys for all those
    Heidi Mattson jokes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another addition to the New Haven business scene is the Image Tattoo Parlor.
    Locals were reassured that it was going to be a clean and sanitary business,
    but are still concerned over rumors that Image plans to hire a recently
    out-of-work celebrity to do their ear piercings-- [beat] Mike Tyson.

    plays &quot;Championship (Deferred)&quot; aka &quot;I Coulda Been The Champ
    if it Weren't for That Chomp.&quot;

    On the legal front, several Yale students are planning on suing the
    University because the co-ed housing situation violates their religion. This
    has inspired several other Yale student groups to file their own suits:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The Yale Pundits are planning to sue because they are forced to live with
      one or two students who actually realize that their pranks are neither
      clever nor well executed
    </li>
    <li>
      The Yale Model Congress plans to sue because they are forced to live with
      people who actually have a life
    </li>
    <li>
      The Yale Objectivist Study Group plans to sue because they are forced to
      live with the worthless scum of the earth who are too small-minded to
      recognize the genius and infallibility of Ayn Rand
    </li>
    <li>
      And of course, the Yale Band plans to sue for mental distress due to the
      fact that they are forced to live side by side [beat] with actual
      musicians
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In fact, in a recent poll 90% of Yale students said that as far as housing
    goes, they envy the Russian Cosmonauts up on MIR, even though the station is
    losing valuable components faster than Paula Jones is losing lawyers.
  </p>

    The Yale administration recently refused a sizeable donation from Seinfeld's
    Kramer to endow a chair in Bursting Into Rooms Unannounced Studies. The
    Brown Band had not been aware that Kramer was a Yalie, but we're not
    terribly surprised, as he certainly looks the part.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the subject of celebrities, Claire Danes has decided to attend Yale
    [beat] at some point in the distant future. Danes' last role as Juliet in
    the recent Shakespeare remake, which was set in a bleak, apocalyptic urban
    nightmare, was probably good preparation for life in New Haven. Contrary to
    popular belief, though, Daines will not put her career on hold while at
    Yale, but will instead start filming a new documentary series-- &quot;My
    So-Called University.&quot;
  </p>

  <p>
    Watch now as the Brown Band forms Danes' greatest asset (and we're not
    talking acting ability here folks) and looks forward to our next visit to
    Yale in two years, by which time we fully expect that she will be a member
    of the illustrious Skull &amp; Bones Society.

    OK, so maybe we're not exactly the UN, but at least as far as fundraising
    goes we make sure our vice president keeps his hands clean. That didn't stop
    Janet Reno however from appointing a Special Prosecutor to investigate our

    Brown Student Agencies announced at the beginning of this year that they
    would start selling cigarettes in Faunce House. Rumor has it that this is
    soon to be followed by the opening of a liquor store in List Art Center, a
    new Guns &#145;N' Ammo Emporium at the Sarah-Doyle Women's Center, and a
    stockpile of discount weapons-grade Plutonium in University Hall. BSA claims
    that their decision was motivated by their concern that addicted students
    were being price-gouged by local convenience stores with a monopoly.
    Apparently, BSA was also concerned by the threat to their own monopoly--
    [beat] on price gouging. We can only wonder if next on their agenda might be
    taking on that guy with the dreadlocks who hangs out in front of Store 24.

    This is the part of the show where we ordinarily make fun of the opposing
    team's school. The only problem is, we know nothing about Lafayette except
    that the name sounds vaguely French. Mind you, we can make jokes about
    France until the cows come home, but really what's the point?
  </p>

  <p>
    So we figured that instead maybe you could tell us some jokes for a change.

    On the International front, the United States is one of the few countries
    who chose not to sign the recent treaty banning land mines. President
    Clinton is on record explaining that he doesn't want to agree to the treaty
    until our military is done exploring (and I quote) &quot;Other
    alternatives.&quot;
  </p>

  <p>
    In an effort to bring the US into compliance, the Brown Band has the
    following suggestions for alternatives:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A) Banana peels</li>
    <li>B) Really tall grass</li>
    <li>C) A great big sheet of flypaper</li>

    The Brown Band was quite saddened to learn that the recent negotiations to
    bring the New England Patriots to Providence fell through. This will surely
    put a dent in plans for urban renewal because, frankly, what downtown
    Providence really needs is more traffic jams. We understand that, even
    though it's not really in New England, the Patriots were also considering
    moving to Princeton. That fell through when it was realized that Princeton
    didn't have a stadium.

    White House documents recently unearthed by the special prosecutor express
    growing worry that America is being left behind in the pop-diva-secret-agent
    department-- in short, a Spice Girls gap. The documents go on to propose the
    formation of the American Spice Girls:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Jersey Spice,</li>
    <li>Bike Cop Spice,</li>
    <li>Walt Whitman Spice,</li>

  <p>
    These documents were unsigned but for some mysterious reason were all
    printed on &quot;From the Desk of the Arkansas Governor&quot; stationery.
    The documents initially propose that the first American Spice concert take
    place in Princeton, but that fell through when it was realized that

    Service: a for-profit non-profit organization dedicated to the proposition
    that if somebody finds a way to cheat on one of their tests, it's not their
    problem. The band managed to get a hold of one of the infamous cheat sheets,
    here's a sample question:
  </p>

  <p>
    Now that Fred, the Dunkin' Donuts donut guy, has retired, what is his new
    slogan?

    Recently, the University formerly known as Penn State has found itself the
    target of a lawsuit. It seems that Penn tried to shut down a nearby pinball
    arcade and, while such Gestapo tactics might have worked in the days of Ben
    Franklin, in these litigious times they just don't fly.

    Penn's President Rodin even had her day in court, despite her protests that
    she was too busy sculpting and destroying downtown Tokyo to testify. Or to
    run a respected university for that matter. Fortunately, her only current
    obligation in this department is the subpoena.
  </p>

  <p>
    University Pinball is located across the street from the Penn school of
    dentistry, and the owners claim that it was not their clientele causing the
    disturbances, but rather Penn students wigged out on nitrous oxide. In fact,
    in their lawsuit they claim that their patrons were often scared off by the
    bloodcurdling screams that were the result of would-be dentists filling the

      to do a War of the Worlds thing... hence if the entire script reads
      something like a radio drama this is on purpose (and has the dual role of
      serving as a backup in case the on-field mike didn't work, which
      fortunately didn't happen). The lines as set down here are really more of

      Interesting weekend we just survived (and we did JUST survive)... The
      Dartmouth Athletic Department wouldn't let either band onto the field, so
      all shows were performed in the stands as best as could be managed, the
      visiting stands were closed down due to the snow, so the Band and all the
      Brown fans had to sit in the home stands mere inches from rabid Dartmouth
      fans, the Brown Bear got pelted with snowballs, the Band was also
      snowballed and even taunted by eight-year-olds.

      The Dartmouth script, running counter to form, was actually witty (as
      written by our own Craig Wenzel's older brother) but true to form included
      a lame top-ten list. I'd been considering including a &quot;Top Ten
      Reasons We Don't Do Top Ten Lists&quot; (#1 being: We don't want to be
      mistaken for the DCMB) in our show this year but didn't because top ten

      The idea to write a show in verse was suggested to me at the 1996 Ivy Band
      Conference by the Columbia Band's Chief Scribe, who had done it the year
      before. At the beginning of this year, I went to the Columbia Band's
      webpage and read their verse script only to discover that, although it was
      all in rhymed couplets, it regularly switched meters. So, in order to make
      the idea my own I decided to use blank verse-- iambic pentameter of
      course. And, of course, it would have to be for the Columbia game.

    Wish good luck to our seniors one and all! <br />
    We hope they're not all homeless [beat] by next Fall.

  <h2><em>Halftime:</em></h2>

  <p>
    Alumni, Ladies, Gentlemen and friends <br />
    Today for your amusement we present <br />
    A group that has its eyes set on Iraq <br />
    Cos we're da bomb. . .
  </p>

  <p>THE BROWN UNIVERSITY BAND!</p>

  <p><strong>[Enter BAND] </strong></p>

  <p>
    Comparisons are odious, &#145;tis true, <br />
    But after seeing that last band in blue <br />
    Suspect do I that you will think this way: <br />
    &quot;Zounds! Odious new meaning found today.&quot;
  </p>

  <p>
    And so our mission stands now to compare <br />
    The Rotten Apple with out own towne fair.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Pawxatucket River is no gem, <br />
    However in comparison you'll find <br />
    Next to the Hudson &#145;tis like Evian <br />
    With crystal waters glist'ning in the sun.
  </p>

  <p>There's something rotten in the state of New York!</p>

  <p>
    {The band in blue, if rumor doesn't lie, <br />
    Once tripped and fell into the Hudson foul. <br />
    Although the tale sounds tall to my trained ears, <br />
    It cert'nly would explain a thing or two. <br />
    An ancient mystery at last is solved: <br />
    THAT'S what befell the powder-blue clad crew! <br />
    An ancient mystery at last is solved: <br />
    THAT'S why the lion looks more like a Smurf!}
  </p>

  <p>
    So now the Band salutes a waterway, <br />
    Which unlike the New York Times is still quite grey, <br />
    By forming fast a water molecule <br />
    And playing &quot;Smells Like Diesel Engine Fuel.&quot;
  </p>

  <p>
    Now to us it would come as no surprise <br />
    If that C-U-M-B did dis' our burg. <br />
    They seem to be obsessed, forsooth, with size <br />
    And pointing out a fact that we all learned <br />
    Back in our kindergarten days with maps <br />
    But seems to some a revalation new: <br />
    Rhode Island is, in truth, the smallest state, <br />
    But I knew that already, didn't you?
  </p>

  <p>
    We're sure they didn't mean to be so mean, <br />
    They're all just homesick for their own home scene, <br />
    So now the Band forms South America <br />
    And plays sweet soothing music for those Smurfs.

    Providence, for all it is divine, <br />
    Does have a few things less than optimal. <br />
    The local cops are no great miracle <br />
    Those meter maids, however, never tire! <br />
    Our Money Man and our Vice President <br />
    Last week ten tickets did accumulate <br />
    between them which they now must quickly pay-- <br />
    The BOOT awaits their cars if they are late. <br />
    The Denver Boot our topic now becomes: <br />
    We hate those ugly yellow tire clams. <br />
    Which is to say we all do knock the boots, <br />
    And so this is the subject for our band.
