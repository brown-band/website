_Thanks to Doug Ballon '69 for the story of Elrod's life._

The Band's beloved mascot Elrod was the creation of a past Band president with probably the shortest tenure in office in the history of the Band.

In Fall of 1967, C. Douglas Ballon '69 teamed up with Roy E. Johnson '69 to lead the Band. Ballon was President. Johnson was Chairman of the Board. Ballon, an art major and cartoonist, modestly drew a self-portrait for the Band's letterhead (It should be noted that Ballon played French Horn in the Band, but also had credentials as the first person to blow "Charge!!!" on a bugle in Shea Stadium--so the depiction with bugle in hand has some historical significance).

In those days, Ballon's cross-eyed likeness of himself was affectionately referred to as "Doogi" by his closer associates. Ballon's presidency which became effective in January 1968 came to an abrupt halt in February, two weeks into the Spring semester. It seemed that Mr. Ballon had devoted a little too much time to writing scandalous half-time shows and playing bridge with sousaphonist Kenneth R. Sloan, Jr. '69. The University thought some time off would improve his academic outlook. Johnson assumed the Presidency of the Band, and Ballon never returned to Brown (as a student, that is). He did later return to the Ivy League to receive a Master of Architecture degree from Yale.

Years later, when his trumpet wielding son, Jacob, was cruising the web searching for colleges, Ballon was amazed and delighted to find his "Doogi" had become an icon named Elrod (Delighted about the icon status, not so wild about the name). In a final piece of ironic trivia, Jacob went on to play in a marching band with a Bruin Bear mascot--the Solid Gold Sound of the UCLA Marching Band.
