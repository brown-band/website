      <strong>Please note</strong>: As with any organization, the culture of the
      Brown Band has changed over the years and as such, the content of the
      scripts has evolved to reflect this change. The band strives to be a
      welcoming, diverse and thoughtful community and the current band members
      do not condone any scripts that appear contrary to this goal.
