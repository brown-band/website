## Events

#### Centennial Alumni Game + Gala, September 28th, 2024

Thank you for making our Centennial Game such a success! With over 200 bandies on the field, we helped Brown be victorious over the Harvard Crimson!

Brown also wrote a [lovely article detailing the event](https://www.brown.edu/news/2024-11-14/brown-band).

#### Alumni Ice Show, Saturday March 1st, 7pm

Scores of alumni found their skates buried in their closets and took to the ice with the world's first Ice Skating Band for our annual Alumni Ice Show against the Harvard Crimson!

#### University Commencement 2025, May 2025

We had a great time at Commencement with everybody! We had a full house for the big day on the Faunce porch and a wonderful turnout for our Opening Reception and BBQ beforehand. Thank you so much for coming and helping to maintain the Band's 100 year winning streak!

## Fundraising

We successfully raised over $100k for our 100th year! Thank you all for your generosity :)
