## Events

#### Centennial Alumni Game + Gala, September 28th, 2024

All Brown Band alumni and their families are invited to join the band in celebration of our 100th anniversary on September 28th! March down to Brown Stadium with us and swell our ranks so we double… no triple… no QUINTUPLE the size of the Harvard Band (if size matters). Then come join us for a banquet that night, as we celebrate 100 years of memories, shenanigans, and dancing! If you are interested in joining, please fill out [this interest form](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forms.gle/Cr2dzFF6c6Vbmw6y9&source=gmail&ust=1713728551922000&usg=AOvVaw2GxxhNNfBqke5ehbyUMPPS) so we know the kind of venue we need to reserve. Spouses + families are invited!

A formal RSVP will be made available soon.

Accomodations can be made with the help of [Brown's visitor info](https://www.brown.edu/about/visit/accommodations)

#### Alumni Ice Show, TBD (Mid February)

#### University Commencement 2025, May 2025

All Brown Band alumni are invited to pick up their instrument (no matter how dusty!) and join the band in a weekend replete with campus marches, dances, and memories! March into cadence with the Band as we lead the charge in the commencement procession!
