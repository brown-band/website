  If you are a fellow band and you are coming up to Brown University, then this is the place for you! Follow the below guidelines to help us out as well as make sure your journey to and stay at Brown goes smoothly:
---

At least three weeks before the event, you should email our [Corresponding Secretary](/leadership/#corresponding-secretary) at [brownbandcorsec@gmail.com](mailto:brownbandcorsec@gmail.com).

Let that person know at which event you want to play and when you plan on arriving and leaving at Brown University. In addition, please notify the corresponding secretary how many band members you will be bringing to the event and if you would like housing from our band.

We will contact the athletic department and notify them you will be coming, so you don’t have to worry about that.

HOWEVER, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING YOUR OWN TICKETS. You can get tickets through [Brown Athletics](https://tickets.brown.edu/athletics/).
