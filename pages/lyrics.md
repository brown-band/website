## Ever True to Brown (#1) {#evertrue}

<cite>Donald Jackson 1909</cite>

**_This is Brown’s official fight song and can be heard after a touchdown or when the team takes the field or the ice. There are two versions: one traditional, and one that’s more... shall we say, suitable for the band._**

We are ever true to Brown,  
For we love our college dear,  
And wherever we may go,  
We are ready with a cheer,  
And the people always say,  
That you can’t outshine Brown Bears,  
With their Rah! Rah! Rah! and their Ki! Yi! Yi!  
And their B-R-O-W-N.

We are ever true to Brown,  
For we love our college dear,  
And wherever we may go (where are we going?)  
We are ready with a beer.  
And the people always say (what do they say?)  
That you can’t out drink the band (one, two!)  
With a scotch and rye and a whiskey dry,  
And a B-O-U-R-B-O-N.

## Brown Cheering Song (#2) {#cheering-song}

<cite>R.B. Jones 1907 and H.S. Young 1908</cite>

When Brunonia’s Big Brown Team is in the game,  
And the whole line is fighting to guard her name,  
And the Bear growls like thunder as the backs crash by,  
There’s a killing on the Old Hill tonight.

Brunonia’s banners are waving in triumph on the hill,  
Brunonia’s cohorts are cheering for the bear has made its kill, (Rah! Rah!)  
This day is Brown’s, Brown’s forever, let the vanquished count the cost,  
So rise, rise and cheer, boys, till the last white line is crossed.

## Brown Forevermore (#3) {#forevermore}

<cite>Fred A. Otis 1903</cite>

Our boys are out there fighting,  
Like they’ve never fought before.  
They’re crashing and they’re smashing  
To roll up a glorious score.  
Let’s give our ev’ry effort  
And we’ll help them go to town.  
And we will all be happy  
With a victory for Brown.

Let’s give a cheer for dear old Brown, and her team of valiant men,  
We’ll raise our voices to the sky, for we will win again,  
We’ll back our team with all our might, just to raise a winning score,  
Because it’s fight, fight for Brown boys, and for Brown forevermore.

## For Bruno and For Brown (#4) {#four}

<cite>John R. Bair 1913 and Donald Jackson 1909</cite>

The name of Brown, boys, shall never fall,  
’Midst the great or small, she is the best of all,  
For her fair name, boys, we’ll win the game,  
And add another victor’s crown.  
So then we’ll smash, crash against the line,  
As in “Auld Lang Syne,” crush them down!  
Then cheer, boys, yes, cheer, cheer, cheer,  
Just for Bruno and for Brown.

## I’m A Brown Man Born {#brown-man-born}

**_The Brown Drinking Song_**

Here’s to good old Brown, drink her down, drink her down.  
Here’s to good old Brown, drink her down, drink her down.  
Here’s to good old Brown, she’s the jolliest place in town,  
Drink her down, drink her down, drink her down, down, down.

I’m a Brown man born, and a Brown man bred,  
And when I die, I’ll be a Brown man dead.  
For it’s rah, rah, Bruno-nonia, rah, rah, Bruno-nonia,  
Rah, rah, Bruno-nonia, Brown Brown Brown.

Oh, we beat Harvard and we beat Yale,  
And we tied a knot in the Tiger’s tail.  
For it’s rah, rah, Bruno-nonia, rah, rah, Bruno-nonia,  
Rah, rah, Bruno-nonia, Brown Brown Brown.

Oh, we beat Dartmouth and we beat Penn,  
But that was back in 1910!  
For it’s rah, rah, Bruno-nonia, rah, rah, Bruno-nonia,  
Rah, rah, Bruno-nonia, Brown Brown Brown.

## In the Fray {#in-the-fray}

<cite>A.G. Chaffee 1902</cite>

When our men get in the fray,  
We’ll watch them play, and shout Hooray!  
And we will help them to win the day,  
Another victory for Brown.  
If perchance our men should meet  
A bad defeat, there’s no retreat,  
For whether we’re up or whether we’re down,  
We’ll fill up the cup and drink to Brown,  
And cheer, and cheer, and cheer,  
Rah! Rah! for Brown! Rah! Rah! for Brown! Hey!

## Ki-Yi-Yi {#ki-yi-yi}

<cite>Edward W. Corliss 1895</cite>

**_To be played when the hockey team scores a coveted goal._**

Ki-Yi-Yi! Come and give a good and lusty  
Ki-Yi-Yi! For our team so tried and trusty,  
Ki-Yi-Yi, boys, come now,  
Give them a good and snappy Ki-Yi-Yi!

## Brown Bear {#brown-bear}

<cite>John B. Archer and Kenneth Quivey</cite>  
**_Polka never dies._**

I hear a cheer ringing loud and clear,  
It brings me back to town;  
It comes from men who are shouting again  
The name of dear old Brown;  
See how they tear through the line,  
That raging Brown Bear varsity;  
You can bet all you got  
That we’re taking a shot  
At another big victory.  
Plunge through that hole!  
Give us a goal!  
Let’s go, Brown Bear, let’s go, wow!

Brown Bear, we hear you growling,  
Go at them now and bite and scratch and hug!  
In all your victories, we’ll be rejoicing,  
And in defeat we’ll still be backing you the same as ever;  
In after years the yearning, to be returning,  
Just to boost that Bruno series gets us going,  
Our hearts o’erflowing  
To cheer once more as before for dear old Brown!

## Bring the Victory to Brown {#bring-the-victory}

<cite>Donald Jackson 1909</cite>

Keep a-cheering for Brunonia!  
And her mighty team today;  
Stand behind the boys who fight for you!  
Ev’ry man must back the play;  
Bend your might to win the fight  
And beat the vanquished down;  
So give a cheer, cheer, cheer for Bruno’s team,  
And bring the vict’ry home,  
And bring the vict’ry home,  
And bring the vict’ry home to Brown!

## On the Chapel Steps

<cite>J.N. Eno 1883 and G.C. Gow 1884</cite>

Here at the pleasant twilight hour,  
When daily tasks are o’er,  
We gather on the chapel steps  
To sing our songs once more.  
The braided branches of the elms  
In silence bend to hear,  
And hoary walls and ancient halls  
Ring back our tones of cheer.

## Alma Mater (“That Song” or “Apple Mango”) {#alma-mater}

<cite>J.A. De Wolf 1861</cite>

**_We play this whenever we win or at special Brown events. Before you play the sound file, remove your hat and stand up. Place your arm around the person next to you and commence swaying._**

Alma Mater, we hail thee with loyal devotion,  
And bring to thine altar our off’ring of praise.  
Our hearts swell within us with joyful emotion,  
As the name of old Brown in loud chorus we raise.  
The happiest moments of youth’s fleeting hours  
We’ve passed ‘neath the shade of these time-honored walls;  
And sorrows as transient as April’s brief showers  
Have clouded our life in Brunonia’s halls.

And when we depart from thy friendly protection,  
And boldly launch out upon life’s stormy main,  
We’ll oft look behind us with grateful affection,  
And live our bright college days over again.  
When from youth we have journeyed to manhood’s high station,  
And hopeful young scions around us have grown,  
We’ll send them, with love and with deep veneration,  
As pilgrims devout to the shrine of Old Brown.

And when life’s golden autumn with winter is blending,  
And brows, now so radiant, are furrowed with care;  
When the blightings of age on our heads are descending,  
With no early friends all our sorrows to share;  
Oh, then, as in memory backward we wander,  
And roam the long vista of past years adown,  
On the scenes of our student life often we’ll ponder,  
And smile, as we murmur the name of Old Brown.
