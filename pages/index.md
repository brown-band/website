## Why join the band?

The Band is a fun-loving group of Brunonians who help to keep school spirit alive at Brown. Whether we are following the football team on the road, cheering on men’s and women’s basketball and hockey here in Providence, or playing for major school events, such as Convocation, we are Ever True to Brown. We interact with alumni, administrators and other students, sharing our love for Brown and leading our appreciative audiences in displaying our school spirit. And when the night falls, we party like there’s no tomorrow. Here are some other reasons to join:

:::script-list

- A. Free food. Everybody loves free things. Free food is something to love.
- B. Away trips. Every semester we follow our sports teams all over the northeast, so you’ll get to bask in the splendor of New Haven, Philadelphia and various other dumps that will make you appreciate Providence so much more.
- C. Music. Do you know the words to the Alma Mater? No? Well, now’s the time to join the Band and learn them. We play several traditional Brown Band songs - including “Ever True to Brown,” and the Alma Mater - as well as band arrangements of popular songs.
- D. Band shows. Football season is your chance to get on the field, point your instruments up, and feel the rush of excitement as you play for the crowd. We are a scatter band, so we don’t care whether you know your left from your right - all you have to do is be willing to run out onto the field with energy and enthusiasm. During the spring semester, we become the world’s only ice-skating band, and take to the ice to perform shows at hockey games. If you don’t skate, we’ll teach you how.
- E. Love. The Band loves you. It wants to bear your children. When you join the Band, you become an indispensable part of a circle of love and tree-hugging harmony that is the envy of any hippie commune. Peace.
- F. The Princeton Band

## What is required to join the band?

The honest and complete answer is absolutely nothing. We know that your time is valuable, so the band doesn’t have strict attendance requirements. If you can’t make all the games, you can choose to come to few each semester, and no one would think twice if you were a slacker busy person. Come when you want, leave when you want, and have as much fun as you want.

Don’t play or own any instruments? That’s fine with us too. We will teach you how to play the instrument of your choice - heck, we’ll even let you borrow one so you can take it to your dorm and disturb all your friends. All we ask is if you can clap in rhythm (drums is for you) or if you can blow hard (the trumpet, my friend).

## So how do I sign up?

Just come to our rehearsals on every Tuesday at 6pm at [Fulton](/fulton/), which is on the corner of Hope and Benevolent Streets (just behind the Orwig Music building). We’ll give you a tour of our facilities and a taste of the music you’ll be soon playing. Feel free to email the [Recording Secretary](/leadership/#recording-secretary) to get on our mailing list. Or, if you have any questions, email anyone on [Band Board](/leadership/#band-board). Lastly, check the [schedule](/schedule/) to see our upcoming games. We look forward to welcoming you to the Brown Band!
