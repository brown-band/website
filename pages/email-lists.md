We have _two_ alumni mailings lists. As of Fall 2025, both are hosted by Brown via listserv. The best way to reach the ALs is by emailing [brownbandals@gmail.com](mailto:brownbandals@gmail.com).

**CHECK YOUR SPAM FOR EMAILS!** Gmail likes to mark messages from Brown listserv as spam. It is very important that you mark our emails as not spam to receive them in your inbox.

## The Everything List

This is the most important list. This is where we send the big updates that you will not want to miss, such as information about alumni games, commencement, and fundraising. Emails are less frequent than the weekly list. **If you only wish to be on one list, this is the one to be on.**

Subscribe or unsubscribe (we'll miss you!) to the list with this [link](https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=brown-band-all&A=1).

## The Weekly List

This is for regular updates on the band's adventures. Emails are usually weekly during the football and hockey seasons, but will tend to slow down during breaks and later into the spring semester. We recommend being on both this one AND the everything list because we will not send the full details of events to the weekly list. Subscribe if you want the most recent news on how we're doing!
