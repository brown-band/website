## Halftime

:sd[the first parts of the show are read in “hellfire and damnation” style]

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, saints and sinners, and all you freshmen mothers and fathers, _and their parents_, presenting the _Original Sin_, it’s yet another episode of great moments in biblical history with the Brown University “fire and brimstone” Band!

:sd[band runs out into two parallel lines. To one side, the Band Trenchcoat Auxiliary is standing with a cardboard foot]

And the Band resided in the land of Holy Cross for many a’day. And there arose in Worcester a Pharaoh who understoodeth not the humor of the Brown Band and forc-ed them to wear silly purple and white jump suits. Yea, and Howard Swearer heardeth the anguished cries of his people, and he senteth the following plagues against the Crusaders:

:::script-list

- A) A 22 year old drinking age
- B) The U.C.S.
- C) Turkey Tetrazini
- D) The Rhode Island political system
- E) The Brown Daily Herald
- And F) the Princeton Band

:::

But the Pharaoh would not let the band go until threaten-ed with yet one more plague: Jacob Neusner. And verily, as the band left Worcester for the promised land of Divine Providence, they found that they did not even have to part the Red See-konk: yeah, they just walk-ed right on top of it! Watch as the band recreateth that fateful voyage while playing “Exodus.”

:sd[band plays “Exodus” while the foot crosses the river. The band then forms a devil’s trident]

Arriving on campus, the band climb-ed to the pinnacle of the sci-li to receiveth the the ten commandments, but, lo, they couldn’t getteth them because they were on three-hour reserve. The band then turned to sin and were banish-ed to the infernal A-Level, where they were forced to read obscure periodicals like “The Scandinavian Actuarial Journal,” and “The Bulgarian Journal of Crustacean Zoology.” And, lo, there the band discovered that 4 out of 5 devils survey-ed recommendeth Tridents for their demons who choose that “Satan Doll.”

:sd[band plays “Satin Doll,” and during the song, the trident turns into a Trident Submarine. There is a second narrator in this part of the show]

Moving from hell to high water, just take a look at that _beautiful_ trident submarine the band has formed on the field, and...

Wait! You’ve had _enough_ free speech! I am placing you under citizens’ arrest for crimes against good taste and decency! I now want to see you form a pair of handcuffs on the field, get down on your knees, and pray for “Penance From Heaven.”

:sd[while this has been read, the band’s Trident formation is broken up by the Band Trenchcoat Auxiliary. The band forms the handcuffs and play “Pennies From Heaven” while on their knees.]

Has this show been too subtle for you? Come to Cambridge next week to see the band stop beating around the bush!

:sd[band marches off to “Ever True’ while the parents decide either to transfer their kids to Rhode Island College or send an extra thousand dollars to Brown at the end of the year]

::script-note[1984 was the year that placing recruiters under citizens’ arrest was in style. Also, Prof. Neusner almost sued the band for mentioning his name!]
