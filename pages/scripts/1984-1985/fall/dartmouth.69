Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Young Unemployed Professionals: it's the Brown University "What do you mean you can't get a job with an I.R. degree?" Band!
</sp>
<sp>
	Today, we salute all the salubrious seniors who have survived seven semesters of semiotics, sociology, Slavic Studies, and Italian Beef Noodle Casserole, as we celebrate the publication of our new book. <em>The Brown Band Guide to Survival in the Real World,</em> otherwise known as <em>The Official Yuppy Handbook.</em>
</sp>
<sp>
	Following in the footsteps of other notorious jobless alums, we have written this book in the hopes that we, too, can appear on the "Today" show. Yes, you can learn how to be a successful Yuppie for the low, low price of just $19.95 plus 50 thousand dollars postage and handling, payable by American Express, American Express, American Express, or two-dollar bills and Susan B. Anthony dollars. This wonderful book includes such scintillating sections as:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A)	How to acquire the right musical tastes -- that is, throw away your Dead Kennedys albums and pick up some dollar-ninety-eight specials from the Brown Bookstore, like "Shostakovich's Greatest Hits."</sli>
<sli>B)	Fashion hints, like "Don't wear your Clash pin on your first day at I.B.M."</sli>
<sli>C)	A list of cocaine dealers in Manhattan who take American Express</sli>
<sli>D)	The right options to order on your B.M.W., such as power windows, power steering, power brakes, and power lunching. And</sli>
<sli>E)	The ten best places to vacation, and why they're all in Colorado.</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Turning from <em>lists</em> to <em>List</em>, our indispensable volume includes this complete index of job opportunities for Art majors:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>F)	The Princeton Band.</sli>

Alas, we realize that tastes in beverages will have to change; Bud by the keg and Jack <sbr/>
Daniels by the gallon must go the way of the beloved Dead Kennedys, in favor of more cultured drinks. Mourn with us now as the Band forms a bottle of Harvey <em>Bristol's</em> Cream -- "It's Downright Upside-Down" -- and plays "Does Anybody Really Know What Drink It Is?"
</sp>

	<sd>Band forms upside-down bottle on the field, and plays "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?"</sd>

	The Band today also bids a fond farewell to its seniors who have given up fours years of their pre-professional preparation to perform in Providence, Pennsylvania, and points elsewhere. Join us now as we send them out of a B.M.W. onto the Park Avenue of life.

<halftime>
<sp>
<sd>band splits in two, half in each endzone. The show is read with two announcers, alternating phrases. One announcer reads the regular type, the other the underlined type, and both read the capitalized type</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	There but for the grace of Brown go we!
</sp>
<sp>
	Ladies and gentlemen, <em>friends and alumni</em>, AND ALL YOU schitzo--- <em>phrenics</em>, proving that two bands on the line <em>are worth one in the bush</em>, IT'S THE BROWN UNIVERSITY "DON'T BLAME ME, I'M FROM MINNESOTA" Deuling <em>Band---shows!</em>
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>each half slowly comes onto the field while playing "Deuling Banjos." The student conductor and the band director are dressed exactly alike, and in a total non-sequitor, there is a string quartet playing on the field, oblivious to all else. Each side of the band creeps down the field as the trumpet soloists play. After end of song, each half forms a computer terminal. While the dialog is read, the conductors proceed to have a duel with capguns, although they keep missing each other and members of the band keep falling down</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	Due to irreconcilable differences, <em>the band this week has divorced itself</em> and the halftime show has been split two ways. <em>But that won't stop us!</em> Today, the left half of the band looks at the terminally ill: the Brown computer science and engineering majors. <em>While the right half looks at those bastions of humanity: the pre-med.</em> Herman Pasko, or "H.P.," as he is better known, disappeared into the computer center two weeks ago, <em>while Thorndyke Q. Worthington the Third has applied for housing on the eleventh floor of the sci-li for next semester.</em> WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A)	Reading "The Little Engineer That Could"</sli>
<sli>B)	<em>Planning pre-med...itated murder</em></sli>
<sli>C)	Placing Sandor Katz under citizens' arrest</sli>
<sli>D)	<em>and</em> E) <em>Falsifying lab data</em></sli>
<sli>OR F) THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
On the left, we show how computers are cutting into our lives by forming a certain word processor on the field and playing "Mac the Knife." <em>And on the right, we salute that pre-med spirit by copying that formation and playing "Cheaty Cheaty Bang Bang."</em>
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>bands play both pieces at once, then form two halves of a heart</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	Wait---this microphone isn't big enough for both of us!
</sp>
<sp>
	<em>No! No! Don't do it!</em>
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>two or three loud shots, director shoots student conductor, and the bear administers CPR</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	Now for a brief word about violence in America today: violins are usually not found in bands, but there ARE two of them today in that quartet on the field! Anyway, watch as the band reconciles itself and salutes its new "Beginning."
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>band plays "Beginnings" while the two halves of the heart join at the middle of the field</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	UGH! How CORNY! What twisted mind conceived of this show, anyway? Be in back in Meehan on December 1 when we have our act together and join stars like Dorothy Hammel, Ty and Randy, and Walt Disney by doing our thing on ice!
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>the halves of the band marches off to "Ever True," leaving the quartet playing by itself, until some band members hurry them off the field. The audience, in the meantime, looks up the nearest available psychiatrist.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>note: Sandor Katz was one of the citizen's arrests students</sd><sbr/>
