Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all of you predominantly primitive, perpetually perspiring, potentially Paleolithic, and probably poxed pusillanimous peons from that pathetic putrefied purgatory called Pennsylvania, presenting an alternative to suicide pills, it's the Brown University "we thought they were aspirin" Band <i>and</i> Band alumni!
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>no one runs out</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	I said, it's the Brown University Band and Band alumni!
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>band de-bushes and forms the number "60" on the field. Toward the end of the dialog, band forms a "depression"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	Yes, it's the band's 60th anniversary this year, and we would first like to welcome the 27 band alumni who have joined us to reflect on the amazing yet little known achievements of this venerable Brown institution. Few people remember, for example, that it was the Brown Band that led the country out of Prohibition in the 1930s---well, <i>actually</i>, we didn't even realize it had existed until 1948! After seeing one of our 1950s bandshows, Masters and Johnson were inspired to write their famous reports. One Saturday afternoon during the Cuban Missle Crisis, the United States Army nearly bombed Rhode Island when they saw what appeared to be a leaking missle on this very field. The Beatles were our backup group on the Ed Sullivan Show, and we're sure you remember us playing at the Woodstock Festival a few years later, in between Jimi Hendrix and Santana. Saluting what was perhaps our greatest deed, we will now show how we straightened out the Great Depression while playing "Happy Days Are Here Again."

<sp>
	<sd>band plays "Happy Days Are Here Again" and straightens out the Depression. We then run into what may simply be called a "circle" while putting on our 3-D glasses</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	But to the Band, time is just <i>another</i> dimension. This seemingly innocuous formation is actually a two dimensional shadow of a three dimensional representation of a fourth dimensional picture of a fifth dimensional cross section of something that usually does not get by the censor! We celebrate the 100th anniversary of the book <i>Flatland</i> by contemplating the implications of this formation while playing "Does Anybody Really Know What Dimension It Is?"
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>band plays "Does Anyone Really Know What Time It Is," then lines up to prepare for our Grand finale---marching into what will hopefully look like the Brown Emblem</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	The band and its ultrasecret trenchcoat auxiliary will now salute our Alma Mater and thank our alumni for their support and interest in the university by forming the Brown Emblem.
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>band marches into the emblem while doing just this</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	Please rise while we play the Alma Mater.
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>band plays Alma Mater and then releases balloons</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
	Be in Ithaca next week to see us once again eliminate the Big Red Scare.
</sp>
<sp>
	<sd>band marches off to "Ever True" while the alum throw to us bills of amazing denominations</sd>
