Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, I'm Alistair Cooke, the host of this afternoon's salute to Public Television, and welcome to episode 497 of Masterpiece Football with the Brown University Band.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>band walks out playing the first few strains of "Masterpiece Theatre," then runs onto field and forms a Rubber Duckie. The Cookie Monster runs onto the field when his name is mentioned</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Aside from the Cornell students here, we realize that there may be a few of you in the audience who do <em>not</em> regularly watch Sesame Street or Mr. Rogers. As a public service, we will now bring you up to date. Last month, the cookie monster had his name legally changed to "the beer and pretzel" monster, and police are still on the lookout for Kermit the Frog, whose disappearance last week just happened to coincide with a French Chef special entitled "Frog Leg Flambee." Authorities recently arrested Mr. Rogers after learning how he <em>really</em> got to the Land of Make Believe. His only comment was, "can you say five to ten for possession? Sure, I knew you could!" After being evicted from his trash can about three months ago, Oscar the Grouch found an even better place to live: a Cornell dormitory. And, of course, you have probably already heard that Ernie and Bert split up after a furious court battle and were awarded joint custody of the Rubber Duckie.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>while the band plays "Rubber Duckie," the formation splits into two. After the song ends, flutes play part of the theme to "Sneak Preview" while the band forms a thermometer</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
And now for a review of that last formation, here are critics Gene Siskell of the Chicago Tribune and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times.
</sp>
<sp>
"Gene, I liked that last formation. It showed style. I'll give it a thumbs up."
</sp>
<sp>
"You suck, Roger, and I hate you! That formation was definitely in bad taste. Why don't you just stick with 'Valley of the Dolls?' I give it a thumbs down."
</sp>
<sp>
"O.K., Roger, so we disagree. But you know what? We couldn't do these shows without your support, so pick up those phones and call us...our operators are standing by! We have several special gift incentives just for Cornell students who contribute over fifty dollars, including an engraved bronzed udder, a parachute, and t-shirt that reads, "I go to Cornell, and my best friends are bovine." And, of course, for <em>any</em> donation, you will receive a Cornell diploma. Just call those numbers listed on the bottom of your field: 1-020-3040. Fill up that thermometer on the field...call <em>now!</em>
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>band plays "Big Spender," and of course, the thermometer overflows. We then form a TV set. Cardboard words appear on the screen as they're read</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Please watch the T.V. on the field as the Electric Company helps you to ruminate on some much needed remedial reading. C---UD....CUD! M---ILK....MILK! M---OO....MOOOOOOOOOO! No, no, no! No need to get excited---it's only a paper moo!
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>band plays "It's Only a Paper Moon"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Stay in your seats as the Cornell Band proves that silence can be golden.<sbr/>
	<sbr/>
<sd>band marches off to "Ever True"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
This show was made possible by a grant from the Exxon Corporation, Shell Oil, and Borden Dairy Products.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>note: PBS televised this game but decided to televise the Cornell bland...I mean band...instead of us. Still, I hear they showed a fascinating documentary about the Brown computer system while we performed our show...</sd><sbr/>
