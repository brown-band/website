## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you Cambridge Commoners, presenting one hundred and three people who are _not_ making it in Massachusetts: it’s the Brown University "we would vote for Ray Shamie if we were millionaires, too" Band!

:sd[band forms an homogenous amorphous blob near the Brown side]

So, the Harvard Band is celebrating their 65th anniversary this year...too bad Massachusetts no longer requires mandatory retirement! But why worry about the ramblings of a senile old band when election day is just around the corner?

Now imagine that you are the Dean of Admissions of Electoral College trying to choose between "where’s the beef?" and "here’s the ham." Fritz wants to come back after a four year leave of absence and is now majoring in women’s studies. Ronnie has consistently failed International Relations and has a 167 billion dollar incomplete in Applied Math. But Reagan has done wonderful things for Massachusetts: he fired the Harvard Square Traffic Controllers. He got Peg Heckler _out_ of the state. And he’s tried to put Massachusetts closer to the heart of America by moving the entire country to the right. The choice is simple: we can either let the country go on the Fritz, or we can all line up for our prescriptions at the Brown Infirmary. Before school breaks for Nuclear Winter Vacation, the band salutes Reagan’s four horseman defense and plays "Suicide is Painless."

:sd[the amorphous blob blossoms into a mushroom cloud while we play theme from "M\*A\*S\*H." We then form what could be described as a ketchup bottle]

However, we all know that Ronald Reagan doesn’t _really_ want to blow us all to kingdom come. But if he _truly_ wants to _share_ things with the Soviets why stop with the Star Wars defense? Why not share all of America’s great technological advances with the Russians? Like Ford Pintos and DC-10’s. Ron Meyer. The Westin Hotel. Miller’s Court. Or the Harvard Core Curriculum. The band salutes Ronald Reagan’s sharp mind by forming a vegetable on the field.....:sd[pause].....you _did_ recognize the ketchup bottle as a vegetable, didn’t you?...as we ponder his missle policies while playing "Processional From Star Wars."

And now, for their rebuttal, the League of Unregistered Voters presents the Harvard Band. Please hold your applause during their performance.

::script-note[there was a power outage in Boston, so we read the show on the P.A. system of an ambulance. Well, it was either that or doing the show in semaphore. So leave me alone. There.]
