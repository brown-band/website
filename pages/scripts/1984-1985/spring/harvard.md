Lady and gentleman, friend and alumnus, and the people who are making us do our show after the game, it's the Brown University "This is even more fun than Winter Weekend" Band!

:sd[Band skates into an '11']

The fact that inflation is down has apparently escaped the notice of our university. The Brown Band would like to propose its own fundraising schemes, like taking a second mortgage on your house, starting a neighborhood drug ring, or selling your little brother for medical experiments. Think of all the fun you would have! Yes, life would be awfully boring without that Magnificent 11%.

:sd[Band plays "Magnificent Seven" and then forms a dollar sign]

Perhaps you've wondered where the money is going. Rumor has it that the Semiotics Department is moving into the Sci Li, a building that better suits its image. The former contents of the Sci Li will be moved into a small closet in University Hall, next to the room with the planned faculty jacuzzi. Little wonder that the University has been doing some Big Spending.

Be back next year as the band "Goetz" down on its knees and asks for tuition money in the New York Subway.

:sd[Band counterskates, etc. and Larry retires to become a capitalist so he can exploit the masses]
