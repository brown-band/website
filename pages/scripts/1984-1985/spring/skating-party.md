Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and Alumni, Presenting the only non-nuclear power ever to be banned from the People’s Republic of China because of its Offensive Capability, It’s the Brown University "You can read about us in the Book of Revelations" Band.

:sd[Skate out while above is read. Play "In The Fray" from the chorus, no repeat. Skate into Monolith]

Bear with us now as the Band skates backwards in time; Back before Madonna was "Like A Virgin"; Back when Twisted Sister would still take it; and back even before seniors needed their lawyers to ask questions at Career Planning.\
 Yea, Back to the edge of history - to a misty time when mankind had but recently emerged from the slime pits, and had its first encounter with intelligence. Unfortunately during that historic event, the Brown Band was, as usual, in Massachusetts buying beer.

:sd[Play Theme from 2001. One bandie skates to center of Monolith and bangs on ice with a drumstick, then throws stick into air. After song, skate into circle. Go around once, and form Space Shuttle]

Turning from Cro-Magnon to Magnum P.I., the Band goes for a spin in a time machine to see if Nostradamus was correct when he predicted:

:::script-list

- A) Konstantin Chernenko’s surprising appearance at President Bush’s second wedding, in 1986
- B) Andy Van Dam’s change of BRUNET into a blonde, in 1987
- C) The presence of Pembroke 68 organizers on the Board of Directors of General Dynamics, in 1988
- and D) The Pentagon’s use of the Space Shuttle to launch a protective device into space to prevent the penetration of Soviet Missiles, in 1989

Watch now as the Brown Band salutes this latest example of military counter-intelligence, forms the Space Shuttle Discovery, and plays "Processional from Star Wars."

Now how much would you pay? But wait! Don’t answer yet because you also get:
