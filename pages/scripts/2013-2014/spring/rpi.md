Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that today consists of friends and alumni, it's the Brown University "ladies and gentlemen" BAAAAAND!

You may have noticed our Band is a little bit bigger and a lot older than usual this evening. Unlike the last time the elderly were following us around, those surrounding us now are not shape-shifting aliens. They are in fact our beloved alumni, rejoining us to relive their glory days of wobbling on knife boots on frozen water while banging and blowing to their hearts' content. Our alumni at this game go as far back as 1969 â€” in fact, the inventor of the button is here now. Thanks for helping us keep our pants on, alumnus! There's a sex joke in there somewhere, but we'll leave that to your imagination.

When we heard we were playing RPI tonight, we really hoped it wasn't Rensselaer again, because we just returned from Troy, where we experienced our very first Little Red Calm Down and laid siege to the city. We just weren't emotionally prepared to see that puck mascot again. So we put our heads together to figure out who else RPI could be.

Tonight's ice show comes on the tail end of the majestic 2014 Winter Olympics. While Sochi was hosting those famous games, we were hosting the Ivy Band Olympics. Events included danger falls, tug-o-challenge, synchronized group phallus formation, making everything sexual... sexually, and the biggest ship competition. We returned victorious with a record-breaking 69 gold medals.

Thanks for coming to support us while we beg our alumni never to leave. Catch us tomorrow at the last hockey game we'll be attending, as our graduating seniors bid us a special farewell. Brown Band out!
