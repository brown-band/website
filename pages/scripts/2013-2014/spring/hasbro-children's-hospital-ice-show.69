Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's so excited
to be here, it's the Brown University "Be Our Valentine" Baaaaaaaanddd!
</sp>
<sp>
It's so nice to be here and skate for you all. Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are
The Brown University Band: a super cool (or should we say ice cold) band! And we're the
only one in the nation that ice skates. Yeah, we're impressive. We're here tonight to
show our love for the Hasbro Children's Hospital on their 20th Anniversary. Twenty years
is a reaaaalllly long time. That's longer than half of our band members have been alive!
And slightly less long than the other half has been alive! Great job, Hasbro Children's
Hospital, you're finally old enough to go to college!

Over its 20-year history, the Hasbro Children's Hospital has done some pretty neat stuff.
For example, in 1998, they performed Rhode Island's first pediatric kidney transplant. In
2002, they repaired a hole in a toddler's heart without opening his chest. We can't wait
to see what awesome, life-saving stuff they'll do in the next 20 years!

plays "I Want You Back" (and "More Than a Feeling", maybe)</sd></sp>

Thanks for inviting us tonight. We are so happy to have taken part in your 20th anniversary
celebration. If you like what you saw tonight, join us again on February 28th at Meehan
Auditorium for our alumni ice show! Brown Band out.
