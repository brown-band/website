Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization whose accolades include topping many listicles, it’s the Brown University “Number One in the Ivy League for fun” BAAAAAAND!

You may be wondering why the Brown Band has descended in the middle of this distinctly non-football-lined field in the middle of this seemingly ordinary day. To be honest, we are too. We’re still a little buzzed from Spring Weekend. In fact, we were under the impression that we were supposed to open last Friday’s concert, but by the time we showed up, another group had usurped us. What Cheer Brigade was that? Anyway, since you missed the opportunity to be serenaded by us last weekend, we’re here now. You’re welcome. Watch now as the Band forms its ranking on the list of funnest colleges.

We bet you all had a pretty good time last weekend, reveling in your youth and drunkenness. But we’ve been concocting some ways to make this weekend even better. Here are our top suggestions:

:::script-list

- A. Fratty in the Ratty 2.0: Less frat, more rat;
- B. Enjoy Easter the right way (420 raise it);
- C. Enjoy Easter the other right way (that’s not the only thing rising);
- D. Dave Binder and Gail duet;
- E. Slip-n-Slide all the way down College Hill into Waterfire; and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Looks like it’ll be a pretty good weekend.

You might have noticed that there’s a bit of a celebration going on for the next year or until the end of days. We tried to put an end-date on it, but that plus sign is pretty ambiguous. How often does a semiquincentenary come around? We’re not really sure - people just keep saying that word. Watch now as the Band forms a B for birfday and plays a comparatively recent Brown jam.

Thanks for humoring us while we humored you with our show. Keep an eye out for us as we serenade prospective students at ADOCH and no-longer-prospective students at the men’s lacrosse game on April 26. Brown Band out!
