Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's here to denounce the evils of truth and love, it's the Brown University "Meowth, that's right!" BAAAAAAND!

You may have noticed that in place of the Brown Bandies you know and love, tonight's show features a band of villains. That's because the recent abundance of good deeds Cornell has done as brought out the evil in all of us. As Brown students, we are devoted to the dissolution of society as it stands. We seek to destroy traditional family values and create a welfare state. Separately, we stand in opposition to everything that Cornell stands for.

What's so bad about Cornell's do-gooding, you may ask? Well, just get a load of all the sickeningly heroic things they've done in recent past.

:::script-list

- A. They heroically destroyed $212,841.83 worth of horse semen, saving the Ithaca area from the threat of horse overpopulation.
- B. They held off on celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr. Day until this year, meaning they could put 30 years of planning into one heroic event. How progressive.
- C. They set heroic standards for their Big Red Bear mascot, including such rules as "not holding babies" and "only approaching women" â€” maintaining, against our evil wishes, the visibility and normalization of heterosexuality.
- D. Heroically apologized for encouraging community members to don sombreros and ponchos in the name of "festivity" before the :sd[dripping sarcasm] "Cinco de Octubre" football game versus Colgate.
- E. American hero Ann Coulter heroically went to Cornell, and
- F. The Princeton Band!

Cornell's heroism has reached unacceptable levels. We, your faithful band of Brown villains, have developed a strategic plan to combat them. For example, we've been jackin' off horses non-stop since the horse semen debacle. Furthermore, one of our mascots is literally a baby bear, and we've also procured as many babies as possible so that our mascots can always be the picture of gender-neutral parenthood. And rest assured, American heroes of Ann Coulter's caliber are firmly banned from our grounds.

Thanks for watching our display of debauchery and destruction. Catch us on the ice again downtown at Kennedy Plaza on February 14, and here at Meehan on February 28. Now, before the authorities lay hands on us, Brown Band out.
