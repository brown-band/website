## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's gonna make it to the Super Bowl this year, it's the Brown University "First and ten, do it again, go Bears go!" BAAANNNNDDDD!

We've been coming to these games for years now, but still have no idea what's going on. Can someone please tell us what all these fouls mean?

:::script-list

- a) Pass interference — isn't the whole point of defense to prevent completed passes?
- b) Neutral zone infraction — is the field Switzerland?
- c) Running into the kicker — RUDE!
- d) Intentional grounding — we're all standing on the ground right now... right?
- e) Offsides — wait a minute, wrong football... and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!

:::

Football is hard, so watch now as the Band does something it understands and plays "NFL on Fox."

Well, the Band might not know much about football, but we do know that this game is going to be ridiculous. Brown's football team is scrappy and dedicated, much like its Band. When anyone tries to get in our way, we just play our sweet, sweet tunes and run away screaming. When anyone tries to get in the way of our football players, our players just tackle them. I guess we're not that similar after all. Watch now as the Band urges its football team to Bring the Victory—go Bruno!

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization: The Brown University Band.

Hello fans! We've got a treat for you. Watch now as the Brown Band assembles into a shape and plays some music.

That was exhilarating! We can't wait to head back to Providence and watch our Bears take on the University of Pennsylvania Fightin' Pacifists. It's our homecoming game, so we don't know hoya's going to happen... and we can't wait to find out! See you on the flipside.
