Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that tried
to go to Mystic Aquarium but ended up stuck in New Haven for five hours, it's
the Brown University "I JUST WANTED TO SEE THE PENGUINS!" BAAAANNNNDDD!
</sp>

Hello, Yale! Since we can't realize our dream of seeing the majestic penguins in
their not-so-natural habitat, we figured we'd talk about the animal most closely
related to a penguin: Handsome Dan. Did you know that Yale's mascot, a live bulldog,
is actually a flightless bird? How did that escape your notice for 312 years?
JUST KIDDING<smdash/>we know that Handsome Dan is a bulldog! And a handsome one at that...
just kidding, again! We're not Dartmouth students. Watch now as the Band forms
Connecticut and plays "Pretty Fly for a Flightless Bird."

Speaking of Handsome Dan, did y'all know that your mascot is the cause of a nasty
breakup between Georgetown's mascot Jack the Bulldog and Bryant's mascot Tupper the
Bulldog? Handsome Dan swept Tupper off all four of his adorable little paws, and
Jack was left out in the cold. Handsome Dan fell head over heel for Tupper, and it
was puppy love at first sight. We're not surprised<smdash/>we hear cheating is common at
Yale. What a dog! Watch now as the Band forms the first letter of the word "bow-wow"
and plays "Dog Cheating Song."

In case you didn't know, the Brown Band takes a strong interest in other school's
newspapers<smdash/>journalism is a passion of ours. We've heard that the Yale Daily News is a
bastion of accurate news reporting, and recently the paper has been top notch. Some of the
best headlines from the past few weeks are as follows:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>a)	Yale Scientists Probe Gender Gap;</sli>
<sli>b)	Campus Preps for Party;</sli>
<sli>c)	Yale Not Considering Honor Code;</sli>
<sli>d)	With New President, Yale Looks to Africa;</sli>
<sli>e)	"Symplicity" Draws Mixed Response; and</sli>
<sli>f)	THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>

Wow, thank goodness these stories were brought to light! Without the Yale Daily News, we'd
be doomed. Watch now as the Band forms a newspaper and plays "Johnny Reports the News."

Speaking of recent Yale news, someone has been pooping in Yale's laundry rooms. Despite the
apparent confusion on Yale's campus, we at Brown are pretty sure laundry rooms are meant to
be for washing clothes, not for pooping. We're not entirely sure how someone could confuse a
washing machine or dryer for a toilet, but apparently it's possible. Or perhaps the so-called
"poopatrator" thought the machines were bidets and coincidentally got a stomach bug at the
most inopportune time possible. Or maybe someone was looking for the Yale Bowl? We hope whoever
it is gets potty trained soon. Watch now as the Band plunges the Yale Bowl and Lives on a
Prayer that no one poops in our washing machines.

Speaking of squirrels, we also hear that y'all have been having a serious problem with your
squirrels. Isn't that nuts? This problem is no oak<smdash/>all of Yale's squirrel population has been
dying out recently, and nobody knows why! This is a serious issue, because squirrels are a
vital part of the Yale student body. We don't know why this is happening... we had a theory,
but it turns out we were barking up the wrong tree. We bet Handsome Dan is at the bottom of
this. Watch now as the Band forms a B and plays "Easy, Breezy, Beautiful, Coversquirrel."

Well, looks like we've got a real barn-burner on our hands! Come back to Providence with us
next week for our last home game of the season against the Dartmouth Fightin' Nerf-herders.
It's also the Senior Game, so we better see you all there! "Bone" voyage and smell ya later.
Brown Band's gone.
