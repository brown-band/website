Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's brought to you by the
Class of 2014, it's the Brown University "We're Graduating!" BAAANNNNNDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
Welcome, fans, to the Dartmouth Game, a time of year when anything goes. I don't think you heard
me correctly<smdash/>anything goes. Prepare yourselves. It's about to get hoya ri-tick-ulous up in here.
Bet you weren't expecting that! We heard through the grapevine that Dartmouth is dating Columbia,
which makes our last two football games of the season really awkward; unlike Tupper the Bulldog,
we don't like breaking up relationships. Guess we'll just have to beat both teams in a display of
football mastery the likes of which the world has never seen. Watch now as the Band forms Beats by
Dre&#8482; <!-- trademark symbol --> and plays "Forget Dartmouth."
</sp>
<sp><sd>Band forms a lowercase b and plays "F**k You."</sd></sp>
<sp>
Speaking of breaking up relationships, here's a list of famous Dartmouth alumni:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>a)	Meryl Streep;</sli>
<sli>b)	Ann Coulter;</sli>
<sli>c)	Frat party breadsticks;</sli>
<sli>d)	Oh, wait, Ann Coulter went to Cornell! Sorry about that;</sli>
<sli>e)	Dr. Seuss; and</sli>
<sli>f)	THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
A little more about those breadsticks<smdash/>apparently, Dartmouth College was raining $30,000 in singles
a year on breadsticks for all frat parties on campus. We think that's pretty cockamamie of Dartmouth;
don't they have anything better to be spending their money on? If not, can we have all those breads-ticks?
Whatever. At least we don't live in a frozen wasteland. Watch now as the Band forms a B for breadsticks
and plays "For Breadsticks and For Brown."
</sp>
<sp><sd>Band forms a B and plays "For Bruno and For Brown."</sd></sp>

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has a lot of feelings,
it's the Brown University "Four more years!" BAAANNNNDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
In case you didn't know, today is the last home game of the year, and therefore it's our senior game!
Watch now as the Band honors its seniors for their dedication to and love for the Band.
</sp>
<sp><sd>Band forms a champagne glass with senior bubbles and plays "Bits &amp; Pieces" after each senior Limerick.</sd></sp>

Our Lena is such a great friend<sbr/>
On her we could always depend<sbr/>
Busting through those glass ceilings<sbr/>
Feeling feelings on feelings<sbr/>
Life without her we can't comprehend
</sp>
<sp>
Catherine has long led the flutes<sbr/>
It will be hard to fill in her boots<sbr/>
A big Rangers fan,<sbr/>
And loved by the band,<sbr/>
Her greatness no one disputes<sbr/>
</sp>
<sp>
Oh what will we do without Nick<sbr/>
He does this sweet magic trick<sbr/>
It's called Danger Fall<sbr/>
And impresses us all<sbr/>
The greatest of all the big ticks
</sp>
<sp>
We'll miss our prez Carrie Danielson<sbr/>
Who tries really hard with her puns<sbr/>
What we'll do next year<sbr/>
We have no eye-dear<sbr/>
With her, the band always won
</sp>
<sp>
Julie, we love her a lot<sbr/>
For her, we have a soft spot<sbr/>
When we change the key<sbr/>
It feels her with glee<sbr/>
She's one of the best that we've got
</sp>
<sp>
We'll miss our sweet flautist named Izzy<sbr/>
We're sad that she has been so busy<sbr/>
She rocks it in Al<sbr/>
So melodious, our pal<sbr/>
When she's gone we will be in a tizzy
</sp>
<sp>
We will desperately miss Ronnie Chiou<sbr/>
We beseech him to please never go<sbr/>
He's a master engineer<sbr/>
We wish he'd stay here<sbr/>
Our love for him will always grow
</sp>
<sp>
We have this one senior named Dara<sbr/>
She's so environmentally aware-a<sbr/>
She loves to do BOLT<sbr/>
And to divest coal<sbr/>
To her who will ever compare-a?
</sp>
<sp>
We'll miss our old CorSec A-Kon<sbr/>
Without her, how will we play on?<sbr/>
The Olympics, she loves<sbr/>
She gives lots of hugs<sbr/>
Her legacy will always live on
</sp>
<sp>
John's graduation we want to postpone<sbr/>
Plays trumpet with such a sweet tone<sbr/>
He was a great money god<sbr/>
Wait, we were supposed to screw in a lightbulb?!?!<sbr/>
Don't let him get in his zone
</sp>
<sp>
Now Bethany is dear to our heart<sbr/>
For her we'd buy borscht by the cart<sbr/>
She's long been a FOBB<sbr/>
She did a great job<sbr/>
We'll miss her when we are apart
</sp>
<sp>
Chimmy is part of our drum line<sbr/>
He mixes the drinks for our fun times<sbr/>
He plays the bass drum<sbr/>
Without him we'll be glum<sbr/>
And his stage directing skills are sublime
</sp>
<sp>
We know this guy who loves baseball<sbr/>
He also loves to catch 'em all<sbr/>
Without our friend Lewie<sbr/>
Our eyes will be dewy<sbr/>
His notes can be heard above all
</sp>
<sp>
Our dear friend Taran Raghuram<sbr/>
Who makes us go "Om nom nom nom"<sbr/>
He led the drum line<sbr/>
And kept us in time<sbr/>
We'll miss him so much when he's gone
</sp>
<sp>
We love to love Kayla Rosen<sbr/>
We're glad we're the group that she's chosen<sbr/>
She's a photography pro<sbr/>
And helps freshmen grow<sbr/>
We're sad that her time here is closin'
</sp>
<sp>
There's this one super-senior named Zach<sbr/>
We want him to keep coming back<sbr/>
These years weren't enough<sbr/>
The future will be tough<sbr/>
His energy and flair we will lack
</sp>
<sp>
We love our conductor named Adam<sbr/>
For all the years that we've had him<sbr/>
From Connecticut he came<sbr/>
Next year won't be the same<sbr/>
Stamford Bridgeport New Haven and Haddam
</sp>
<sp>
Our awesome grandma is Cooper<sbr/>
We think that he's just super duper<sbr/>
He loves dinosaurs<sbr/>
And him we adore<sbr/>
This grandma sure is a cougar
</sp>
<sp>
We're going to miss our friend Brendon<sbr/>
On his skills as a trump we're dependin'<sbr/>
The solo, he'd rock<sbr/>
He's got Vehicle on lock<sbr/>
We're sad that his time here is endin'
</sp>
<sp>
Chris Wright is a chemistry whiz<sbr/>
He can ace every single quiz<sbr/>
We really can't lie<sbr/>
We love his bowtie<sbr/>
In all, he's the best in the biz
</sp>
<sp>
Our friend Dennis plays the trombone<sbr/>
His graduation we bemoan<sbr/>
His perfection is true<sbr/>
We wish we were you<sbr/>
Without him we'll be so alone
</sp>
<sp>
Zifan is a master of Go<sbr/>
And puts on quite a trump show<sbr/>
It's really a shame<sbr/>
It's his last home game<sbr/>
He's one of the best we know
</sp>
<sp>
Farewell to our good friend Kyle<sbr/>
He always goes the extra mile<sbr/>
He loves Model UN<sbr/>
He's from Switzerland<sbr/>
We'll really miss his sunny smile
</sp>

We've got one more game this season, and it's happening in New York City as the Brown Bears take
on the Fightin' Cowardly Lions Without a Nerve. We'll miss Historic Brown Stadium, but are
looking forward to hockey season! We love you, seniors! BROWN BAND OUT.
