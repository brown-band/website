## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that can’t wait to turn eighteen and get out of this house, it’s the Brown University “You don’t understand me, mom!” BAAAANNNNDDD!

Hey everyone! You may have noticed that these adults have been following us. In fact, they’ve been following us around for 18 to 47 years. We’re getting kind of sick of it. It’s extra weird because they look a little bit like us! Luckily, these adults are our parents. Which is a relief after last week, when we really couldn’t shake a group of clingy middle-aged doppelgangers whom we had never met before. That was kinda weird. Watch now as the band forms our love for our families and plays “Hello, Irene.”

Remember those impostor parents we were talking about? Turns out they were a bunch of shape-shifting aliens. They were trying to take over the world, and their first step towards conquering Earth was for us to tell them all our secrets. What a weird situation. Luckily it was a day game, so we were able to resist the temptation and guard our secrets. But wait, we hope we haven’t alien-ated all the parents in the audience yet. Watch now as the band forms a B and plays “Brown Cheering Song.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s just going to make a Tony the Tiger joke, it’s the Brown University “WEEE’REEEE GREEEEAATTTT” BAAAANNNNDDD!

Sorry, we didn’t have anything else. Hello fans, and welcome to halftime. Guess what happened at Princeton recently—during a period of construction at New Jersey’s second-most prestigious university, students were confused while their doors were being renovated. As a construction worker hammered away, one particularly alert student mistook the noise for gunshots and called the Princeton Police. While we’re proud of that student for recognizing his or her civic duty, we’re confused as to why he or she had neither seen nor heard hard labor before. What does that say about Princeton students? You decide. Watch now as the Band shows Princeton what a gun doesn’t look like and plays “More than a Hammer.”

Speaking of tools, did y’all hear about General Petraeus? Well, he’s a Tiger alumnus who cheetah’ed on his wife! How embarrassing! Watch meow as the Band forms the general’s ride and plays “Vehicle.”

So we don’t know if you’ve heard the news, but it’s expected that illustrious Brown alumna Janet Yellen will become the next Chairperson of the Federal Reserve. This must be embarrassing for Princeton alumnus Ben Bernanke, who no longer holds the position... Here at Brown, our alumni are successful and awesome. At Princeton, their fictional alumni are better than the real ones. For example, the following fictional people graduated from that small school in New Jersey:

- a) Jack Donaghy;
- b) Dr. Manhattan;
- c) Doogie Howser;
- d) Sam Seabourne;
- e) Bruce Wayne; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!!!

Wow, that list makes us want to go to Princeton... JUST KIDDING! Thank goodness we’re at Brown. Watch now as the Band forms the school we’d rather go to and plays “Princeton Nevermore.”

:sd[Band forms BROWN and plays “Brown Threevermore.”]

Golly ghee willikers, this game is gettin’ crazy! Well, next week’s about to get even crazier as the Brown Bears head to Ithaca to battle the Big Red Hoyas. We’ll see you back at Historic Brown Stadium on November 2nd for our homecoming game against the University of Pennsylvania’s Fightin’ Oatmeals. Stay classy and have a great family weekend!
