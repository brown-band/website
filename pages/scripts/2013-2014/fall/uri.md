## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that couldn't exist if Rhode Island didn't, it's the Brown University "Buddy Cianci's Favorite" BAAANNNNDDD!

The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations is a great place to live, but not if breaking obscure laws is your favorite hobby. Rhode Island's legal code has a tangle of confusing legalese with which to ensnare innocent law-abiding citizens... but also laws that seem out of place in 2013. For example...

:::script-list

- a) It is considered an offense to throw pickle juice on a trolley;
- b) It is illegal to challenge someone to a duel, or accept a duel, even if it is never actually fought;
- c) It is illegal to place a windmill within twenty-five (25) rods of any traveled street road;
- d) You may not sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a Sunday;
- e) Impersonating a town sealer, auctioneer, corder of wood, or a fence-viewer is against the law with a fine of $20-$100; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!

:::

Wow, it's a good thing we got rid of our pickle juice yesterday! Watch now as the band forms a sword and plays "Joshua."

Another reason why Rhode Island is great place to live is its... pizza? You heard that right! In Travel and Leisure's March 2013 issue, Providence was ranked #2 in the magazine's search for Best Pizza in the US! That's right, WE BEAT NEW YORK. Travel and Leisure praised Rhody's famous grilled pizza, and only Chicago's deep dish variety was good enough to keep us from that number one spot. We'll never go hungry for pizza again! Thanks, Rhode Island!

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that's woefully underprepared for the worst natural disaster of all time, it's the Brown University "TICKNADO ALLEY" BAAANNNDD!

We don't know if you've heard, but some serious schnikies are going to go down in the State of Rhode Island. That's right, folks, the tick's about to hit the fan. Researchers at the University of Rhode Island have discovered that TICKNADO 2013 is coming. They have a crack team of tick-sperts at the Tick Encounter Research Center who are spreading the news about this horrifying disaster. Everybody look at your legs RIGHT NOW! They're probably covered in ticks! Stay on your guard—they strike at midnight. Watch now as the Band forms Ticknado 2013 and plays "Midnight Ticknado."

If you thought that URI spent all of its time expanding its tick-tionary, YOU THOUGHT WRONG. The campus is as prepared for a ghost apocalypse as it is for a tick apocalypse—the University of Rhode Island Ghost Hunting Team, or URIGHT, is on the job! URIGHT has been protecting Kingston from the supernatural for years, though we're not sure how much an average URI student actually encounters paranormal activity. We're proud to say that, at Brown, we're only haunted by our inner demons. Watch as now as the Band forms our inner demons. Bustin' makes us feel good.

Aside from having some unique emergency preparedness teams, URI also has a great newspaper called The Good 5-Cent Cigar. We have no idea what that means, but we're pretty sure that prolonged exposure to it will cause cancer. Their subheading is "Just What This Country Needs"—are they implying that the country needs more five-cent cigars? In this economy, where would one even purchase five-cent cigars? Truthfully, we'd take the BDH over a five-cent cigar any day of the week. Let's give a cheer for dear old Brown Daily Herald.

Hoya's up, folks? We've sure enjoyed playing for you thus far, and can't wait for the exciting conclusion of the fight for the Governor's Cup. It's getting pretty ri-tick-ulous out here, so we hope Bruno wins! Come along with us as we visit Bryant next week—it's our first time there, and we couldn't be more excited. See you in the post apocalyp-tick week ahead!
