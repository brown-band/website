We've been coming to these games for years now, but still have no idea what's going on. Can
someone please tell us what all these fouls mean?

<sli>a)	Pass interference<smdash/>isn't the whole point of defense to prevent completed passes?</sli>
<sli>b)	Neutral zone infraction<smdash/>is the field Switzerland?</sli>
<sli>c)	Running into the kicker<smdash/>RUDE!</sli>
<sli>d)	Intentional grounding<smdash/>we're all standing on the ground right now... right?</sli>
<sli>e)	Offsides<smdash/>wait a minute, wrong football... and</sli>
<sli>f)	THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

Football is hard, so watch now as the Band does something it understands and plays "NFL on Fox."

Well, the Band might not know much about football, but we do know that this game is going to be
ridiculous. Brown's football team is scrappy and dedicated, much like its Band. When anyone tries
to get in our way, we just play our sweet, sweet tunes and run away screaming. When anyone tries
to get in the way of our football players, our players just tackle them. I guess we're not that
similar after all. Watch now as the Band urges its football team to Bring the Victory<smdash/>go Bruno!

Hello fans! We've got a treat for you. Watch now as the Brown Band assembles into a shape and plays some music.

That was exhilarating! We can't wait to head back to Providence and watch our Bears take on the University
of Pennsylvania Fightin' Pacifists. It's our homecoming game, so we don't know hoya's going to happen... and
we can't wait to find out! See you on the flipside.
