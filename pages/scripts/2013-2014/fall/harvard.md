## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that likes dem apples, it's the Brown University "MATT DAMON!" BAAANNNDDD!

The Brown University Band is depressed to announce that the famous Good Will Hunting Dunkin' Donuts is closing. It's the last building with any real estate value left in Boston, so when we heard the news, we knew there was nothing left to live for. Efforts by the Harvard Board of Trustees to preserve this building were met with fierce resistance from the City of Boston, as it just recently signed a billion dollar deal with Papa John's. Now where can we get our donuts?? OR DEM APPLES?? The world will never know.

:sd[Band forms a donut and plays "Smooth."]

Also native to Cambridge, every year the Harvard Crimson releases a list called "The Fifteen Hottest Freshmen of Harvard." In the spirit of their voyeurism, we've decided to compile the Fifteen Hottest Hipsters of Providence. Some highlights include: that cutie rockin' a cardigan and drinking out of a Mason Jar; that independent concentrator who really wants to tell you about it; and that hot piece of locally-sourced, organic... kale. MMMMM. Watch now as the Band plays "Hipsters Forevermore." You've probably never heard of it.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization who knows how to be successful at Harvard, it's the Brown University "Drop out now!" BAAAAAAAAAAAAAND!

In other news, the New York Times ran a headline on September 16th that read, "Students accused of cheating return awkwardly to a changed Harvard." We won't comment on the well-known cheating scandal, but we will give you fans some other reasons why it may be awkward to return to Harvard:

:::script-list

- a) Your chauffeur was late and made you miss your private jet back to Cambridge;
- b) You forgot that the statue of John Harvard is coated in urine;
- c) You completely alienated yourself after creating and/or stealing a social network;
- d) You are Larry Summers;
- e) You thought you were going to MIT; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!

Dang son, it's a good thing we don't come to Cambridge on a regular basis! Watch now as the Band forms MIT and plays "I Touch John Harvard."

Speaking of Larry Summers, he's officially TOO RICH to be in charge of America's money. Instead of being too big to fail, he's actually too big to succeed. It's kind of embarrassing that the other Harvard professors, especially Elizabeth Warren, wouldn't vote for him! Way to look out for your alumni, Harvard! At Brown, we protect our own, much like an angry mother bear. Watch now as the Band forms a Laffer curve and plays "I'll Make a Larry Summers Out of You!"

While perusing the Harvard Bookstore the other day, we came across a book called Fifty Shades of Crimson. At first we didn't want to read it, but unfortunately it was assigned to us in our S/NC first year seminar. Imagine our surprise when we heard that Harvard already has a Fifty Shades of Crimsonâ€”what Fox News' incisive analysis deems a "kinky sex club." We thought WE had a monopoly on that sort of thing! :sd[really long pause with awkward breathing] We don't know how to feel about this. Watch now as the Band forms fifty shades of Brown and plays "Fifty Shades of Fray."

:sd[Band forms a B and plays "In the Fray."]

Heyyy fans, guess hoya? Next week, the Bears are back in Providence for a compelling game against Big Rhody Fresh. They're our home state rival, so be sure to come out and support as Bruno fights under the lights. Godspeed, Cambridge. May the force be with you.
