Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that knows Hoyas on Second,
it's the Brown University "H-O-Y-A-THE-HECK! HOYA *CLAP* THE HECK!" BAAANNNNDDD!

<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Say, Dennis, are you excited for Georgetown football this year?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> I don't know much about the team.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Well let's go through the lineup, shall we? Let's see, looks like Hoya's the name of the second baseman<smdash/><sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> That's Hoya I'm asking you.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Hoya are you asking me?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> Hoya's the name of the guy on second base?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> That's correct.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> Hoya is?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Yes.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> So wait a minute. Let's say the second baseman is a real upstanding player and I want to cheer him on. Me being
a good fan, I want to yell his name really loudly when he walks out of the dugout. So he steps up to the plate and I get
up from my seat and I call him Hoya?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Naturally.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> Naturally?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Naturally.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> I call him Naturally?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> No, you call him Hoya.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> I have no idea what you're talking about.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Most people don't. While we regroup, watch now as the band forms a baseball and plays the "Ding Dong Song."

<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> So we've got Hoya on second. What do you know about the rest of the football team?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Well, we've got t&amp;iuml;s on first.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> That's what I want to know.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> That's what I'm telling you, t&amp;iuml;s is on first.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> Ook oyta.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Third base!<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> Now how did we get to third base?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> You said the feller's name.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> T&amp;iuml;s.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> No, he's on first.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> T&amp;iuml;s is on first?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> That's right!<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> So t&amp;iuml;s is on third?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> No, t&amp;iuml;s is on first.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> You know what? Oo pragma tuma moy esty.<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Lewie</sdlgename> Hoya did you say?<sbr/>
<sdlgename>Dennis</sdlgename> Oo pragma tuma moy esty.<sbr/>

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has a lot of new freshmen,
it's the Brown University "First Game of the Season!" BAAANNNNDDD!

Hello fans! You may have noticed that Beautiful Brown Band is the only music-playing organization
present at today's game. We miss the Georgetown Band, and aren't sure why they are absent. So we figured
some reasons why the Georgetown band couldn't make it, as told by their Georgetown Police Blotter:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>a)	An intoxicated male identified as a Georgetown student was found knocking down trash cans
and the case was handed off to the Student Conduct Board;</sli>
<sli>b)	A student failed to comply with Georgetown's mandatory recycling policy and disciplinary action
had to be taken;</sli>
<sli>c)	An intoxicated male identified as a Georgetown student was found knocking down trash cans and
the case was handed off to the Student Conduct Board... again...;</sli>
<sli>d)	Two female Georgetown students got into a fight and it is reported that one female twisted the
other female's arm. At present, the case is under investigation;</sli>
<sli>e)	A Georgetown alum was impeached for lying under oath while in office and then acquitted by the
United States Senate; and</sli>
<sli>f)	THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>

Watch now as the Brown Band misses the Georgetown Band and plays "Bad Romance."

Did you know that Georgetown has its own live bulldog mascot? It's kind of like that other school that has
a bulldog for its mascot that's more famous... but we can't remember its name. Unfortunately for the students
of Georgetown, their friendly neighborhood dog Jack the Bulldog is retiring after this year. The leading
candidate bulldog, JJ, was recently rejected on his quest to fill Jack's inimitable pawprints. The Brown
Band recently found JJ's diary, and here's the entry from the day he got fired:<sbr/>
"Dear Diary, woof! Today was a ruff day! I'm barking mad that I'm not Georgetown's Bulldog. I mean, you bite
one kid<smdash/>one little nip!<smdash/>and all of a sudden you're not fit to live on a college campus. Throw me a bone, why
dontcha? JJ out."  Wow, really riveting stuff. Watch now as the Band forms Attack JJ and plays "I Want You Back."

The next day, things took a turn for the even ruff-er for our lovable hero JJ. As we found in his next diary
entry, his personal life fell apart as his professional life crumbled. He barked, "Dear Diary, guess Hoya? Not
only did I just lose my job, but now I've found that Handsome Dan is Handsome Cheating On Me! I mean, it's not
like same-sex bulldog marriage was legal at Georgetown, but Handsome Dan and I were involved in a committed civil
partnership. We even bought a doghouse together, for god's sake! But I trotted into the doghouse and saw him with
Tupper! That bulldog from Bryant! My heart broke into a million pieces, much like a bowl of kibble. Time to go bit
another kid. What've I got to lose?" Poor JJ, that dog's had a hard life. Good thing Bruno the Bear loves it here at Brown!

Well, we've got a real barn-burner on our hands. If only the Georgetown Band had been at this game... Oh well! Join
us next week as we ford the Charles and take on the Fightin' Crimsons. Roll Tide! It's a night game, so that means
fun. Be there or be Harvard Square. See you later, alligator!
