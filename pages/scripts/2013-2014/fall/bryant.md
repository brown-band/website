## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that’s never been here before, it’s the Brown University “Nice to Meet You, Bryant!” BAAANNNNDDD!

Hello Bryant! We’re very excited to visit you out in Smashing Smithfield—it’s always nice to meet another Rhode Island school! We hear that it’s your 150th Anniversary this weekend, and we couldn’t think of a better way to spend this Saturday than celebrating with you! Watch now as our band forms a champagne bottle and plays Sweet Caroline.

Apparently, our two schools are more connected than you might think! Bryant once owned a whole host of buildings on our campus: Perkins Hall, Orwig Music Building, Steinert Practice Center, and Fulton Rehearsal Hall... wait a minute, the Brown Band lives in Fulton Rehearsal Hall! Does that also make us the Bryant Band??? Watch now as the Band has an identity crisis and plays “I’m A Brown Man Adopted.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that loves Mr. Rogers, it’s the Brown University “Would You Be My Neighbor?” BAAANNNNDDD!

Barney Rubble and Fred Flinstone. Lucille #1 and Lucille #2. Homer Simpson and Ned Flanders. Dennis the Menace and George Wilson. Spongebob and Squidward... and Patrick. Mr. Feeney and the Matthews Family. All of Sesame Street. Gerald and Hey Arnold. Dexter and Mandark. Kramer and Seinfeld. America, Mexico, and Canada. And continuing in this long and glorious tradition of folks living next to each other, Bryant and Brown. Watch now as the Band forms our neighborhood and plays an ode to being neighbors.

Given that Bryant is celebrating its 150th Anniversary, let’s take a look into the past. The Civil War was on, Abraham Lincoln had just read his famous Emancipation Proclamation, and Bryant University was founded. Brown was celebrating its centennial and, surprisingly, the government wasn’t shut down... though it was having some serious issues at the time. We’re not saying that we wish we could go back to the Civil War, but we are saying that we wish the government wasn’t shut down. We’d like to Time Warp out of this apocalyp-tick scenario and return to simpler days. Watch now as the Band makes history with Stonewall Jackson and plays “Here’s to Another 150 Years.”

By the way, we hear that your mascot is an adorable bulldog named Tupper. We’re jealous—it’s hard to get cuddly with a bear. Apparently, to celebrate your homecoming, you had an event called “Where’s Tupper?” but we suggest that, next time, you call the event “Tupper: Where?” Maybe your puppy could be found in the following places:

- a) One of Saturn’s moons;
- b) Fulton Rehearsal Hall;
- c) Saving someone from a well;
- d) In Taylor Swift’s Newport mansion;
- e) Hanging out with Eli the Yale Bulldog; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!

The one good thing about bears is that it’s harder to lose them. We hope that you find Tupper! Watch now as the Band forms a B for both of our schools and plays “For Bryant and For Brown.”

Fans, we know that you’re all asking, “Hoya’s next?” We’ll tell you—the Bears head back to Providence for our Family Weekend game against the Princeton Giant Stripey Cats. It’s a night game, so get ready to tell all of your secrets! We look forward to seeing you there. Thanks for having us, Bryant! See you next year.
