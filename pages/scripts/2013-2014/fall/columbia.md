## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s conducting a comprehensive, convoluted war on fun, it’s the Brown University “F is for fire that burns down the whole town!!!” BAAANNNNDDD!

Hello, New York City! We hear that, come January 2014, you’re going to have a new mayor! That’s good, because we were stopped and frisked three times on the way over here. Talk about a convoluted war on fun! What’s next, New York City—banning all sodas? Fining people $25 for flirting? Making people take pass a swim test? Having a core curriculum? Boy oh boy, we’re sure glad we live in Providence, the funnest city in the world. Watch now as the Band forms the open curriculum and plays the most fun song you’ve ever heard.

Speaking of no fun, we hear that Columbia recently conducted a survey about general happiness on campus and satisfaction with the school. Shockingly, on a scale of negative three to positive three, overall satisfaction at Columbia University is only a point eight. We don’t even know what to say to that—first of all, what kind of scale is negative three to positive three? What the hoya, Columbia? Maybe more people would’ve been satisfied with this University if it knew how to conduct a survey correctly! Watch now as the Band forms a scale and plays “Negative Three Out of Three.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that went to the elephant graveyard against its father’s wishes, it’s the Brown University “Here comes a lion, Father, oh yes, it’s a lion” BAAANNNNDDD!

Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase. Hakuna Matata, ain’t no passing craze. It means no worries for the rest of your games—it’s our fumble free philosophy, Hakuna Matata. When we were a young Elrod, when the Band was a young ELLLROOODDDD... we found our halftime shows had a certain appeal. We would spread our cheer all over the field! We’re a musical Band, though we like pigskin. And it hurts when AD’s always censor OURRR SCRIPTSSSSS... so it’s a good thing this one was fine! Watch now as the Band forms the Circle Dance of Life and just can’t wait to make a man out of you.

Speaking of movies, New York City is a popular location for cool action films! Unfortunately, it often gets destroyed, as happens in The Lion King. Other movies in which New York is utterly decimated are...

Watch now as the Brown Band destroys New York in its upcoming feature flick “Halftime Show” and plays “My Heart Will Go On.”

And now, a word (or several) from our president: “A lion doesn’t cheat, but a Tiger Woods.” Watch now as the Band forms Tiger Woods and plays “Brown Tigerevermore.”

Well, folks, this is the last football game of Fall 2013. We’d like to thank you, fans, for supporting us as we run around on the field and play beautiful tunes, and we’d like to thank our football team for a great season. We can’t wait to see you at hockey and basketball games—look out for the Brown Band as we play while we ice skate! Peace out, cub scouts, and see you on the flip side.
