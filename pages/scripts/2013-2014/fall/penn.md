## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's about to dedicate the statue of a DEFINITELY MALE bear, it's the Brown University "IT'S A SPECTRUM" BAAANNNDDD!

Well, fans, Brown's done it again. In case you thought there weren't enough bear statues on campus, you're in luck! Tonight, after this cool and exciting sports event, the Brown Band will be dedicating the new "Indomitable" statue outside of the Nelson Fitness Center. At an impressive ten feet tall, weighing in at about eighteen ounces, and made completely out of bear, Indomitable is a sight to behold. Be sure to stop by and visit this majes-tick specimen at his new home. Watch now as the Band forms Indomitable and plays "I'll Sculpt a Fully Mature Male Bear Out of You."

Also going on tonight, though much later than this dedication, is the famed SPG party. If you don't know what that means, ask Bill O'Reilly! Though he can't attend, our new bear friend Indomitable can... where he'll really be a bare Brown Bear. Watch now as the Band reenacts SPG and plays "Brown Bear."

In case y'all hadn't heard, it's Brown's Homecoming today! We're pretty excited, even though we thought we had already come home. That being said, we're always more than happy to come again! We love Brown sooooo much. Watch now as the Band forms a B for Brown Bear and plays "Welcome to Homecoming."

Oh man, if you think this game's good, wait until next week when the Brown Bears take on the Yale Pomeranians! We'll be in New Haven, which apparently looks better in the dark. What does that even mean? And hoya the heck is that smell? We'll be much happier in two weeks when we return to Providence for our game against Dartmouth. Happy homecoming, Brunonia! Brown Band out.
