## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that totally remembers what team it’s playing against, it’s the Brown University “what do you mean this isn’t Bryant?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We’re here today to play against the best college 160 miles away from NYC! That’s why Brown is now proud to present itself as the best college 62 miles away from space. The abroad program may be a bit cumbersome, but at least you don’t have to drive through New Jersey to get there!

Watch now as the Band blasts off and plays “A Wrinkle in Time.”

:sd[Band forms “a rocket”  and plays Time Warp.]

You can learn a lot about a college from its mascot. You can see just how strong and powerful every Brown student is just from a look at our bear. You can see just how original Cornell is from looking at THEIR bear. And Dartmouth! And of course, what better animal than the ram to show off URI: All fluff and no substance.

Watch now as the Band rents out Rhody the Ram for an hour for $75 dollars, and plays “I Want Ewe Back.”

:sd[Band forms “a battering ram” and plays I Want You Back.]

Wait, URI has a sport called “Oozeball”? What are we doing at a football game then?! This game’s been a snoozeball. After we’re done mudslinging in this script, we can go do some literal mudslinging–and it’s a lot cheaper to watch, too! I’m sure there will be no repercussions to bringing our instruments into a mud pit.

Watch now as the band gets down and dirty and plays “For Bruno, Turning Brown.”

:sd[Band forms B and plays #4.]

Catch us at halftime when we ram the ball into URI’s dining hall.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that still remembers our old moving forms, it’s the Brown University “If they didn’t like it they should have changed the name of their dining hall” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

So we heard something about a “Rhodyfest” at URI? Now, we like rhododendrons as much as the next band, but we’re not sure how you could devote a whole festival to–wait, wait, I get it now. Hold on, you named it after a state? Why? That’s like if Yale had a big event called “Connectidyfest.”

Watch now as the band avoids New Haven and plays “Rhode to Nowhere.”

:sd[Band forms “Connecticut” and plays Pretty Fly]

Have you ever seen a cliff towering over the sea with an empty bench for two? This, too, is URI. Here are some other types of URI we have categorized:

::: script-list 
- A. Doomed URI
- B. Toxic URI
- C. Subtextual URI
- D. URI on Ice 
- E. URI Gagarin
- F. The Princeton band!

Watch now as the band realizes they’ve been mispronouncing this school’s name the whole time and plays “Bad Roman C.”

:sd[Band forms “heart” and plays “Bad Romance”]

Wake up, sheeple! Brown Band Out.
