## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s finally embracing itself, it’s the Brown University “so that’s what a love seat is” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Space. Time. Feel the space pass by you. Let the time flow through you. Love. Laugh. Learn. From the people around you. All things come in twos. Do good, not evil. Inhabit life, don’t die. Carry on my wayward son. Kill ‘em all 1989.

Watch now as the brand celebrates the cycle of life and death and plays “Ding Dong the Witch is Dead.”

Among the Ivies, Yale is known for its large number of secret societies. You can tell they’re secret societies because they have Wikipedia articles, and you can tell they’re Yale secret societies because their names all sound like YA fantasy novels. “Skull and Bones,” “Scroll and Key,” “Wolf’s Head Society” . . . they’re one plucky young rebel leader away from crushing a fascist regime.

Watch now as the band does things by the book and plays “Trope-a-cabana.”

We will now proceed to use up all the puns on Yale alumni we can think of so we don’t have to use them later. I won’t beat around the Bush: there’ll probably be a Price on our heads for this one. Even if the students want to Stone us, they’ll never stop our ad-Vance. We’ll Kerry on and Ford the rivers of anger! Beat Okay, that one was a stretch.

Watch now as the band does Alito trolling and plays Rock Foster.

Catch us at halftime when we travel back in time to 9 AM to wake you up again.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that craves attention because their parents didn’t give them any, it’s the Brown University “HOOOOOOOOOOOOONK” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Give a great warm welcome to bandies past, present, and future! Yale’s alumni go on to congress, the supreme court, and the white house. Our alumni go off to do greater things - like playing with the band again. We’ll leave it up to you which you think adds more value to the world.

Watch now as the band reclaims its lost children and plays “Bandie Wonderland.”

While you’re in the grand old city of New Haven, there’s plenty of things to do and sights to see. Here are a few of our favorites!

:::script-list

- A. Pizza that’s totally better than New York’s
- B. Holy Land, U.S.A., an amusement park that’s probably not sacrilegious
- C. New York City commuters
- D. Some cool wall paintings! Don’t ask where Yale got them
- E. New Haven Metro North, which makes New Haven technically a New York City suburb, and
- F. The Princeton Band!

If you look to your left, you’ll see a wild Yalie in their natural habitat–pain and sadness. Watch now as the band gets stuck in traffic and plays “Off Course.”

We’ve received a message from Yale’s most handsome resident. It went something like this: Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark WOOF.

Watch now as the band gets gelded and plays Brown Men Reborn.

Connecticut is a deep state lie. Brown Band Out.
