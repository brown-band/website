## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization from a small school in Rhode Island, it’s the Brown University “UPenn is large” BANNNDDDDDDDD!

We’re excited to be playing at Penn tonight! We’ve heard that there're some fantastic teams here in Philadelphia! We’ve been told that their baseball teams make some astounding throws, and their football teams make some shocking passes. It’s sure to be a fun game tonight - after all, nothing ever’s gone wrong in Philadelphia in October.

Watch now as the band thrusts its quarterback into the endzone and plays “Philly Cry.”

:sd[Band forms Two Footballs and the Endzone and plays Pretty Fly.]

There are many monsters on the streets tonight, but within the halls of this very school are the most terrifying monsters of all: Business majors. You can’t even scare them off with the smell of garlic–they love that musk! We ain’t afraid of no ghost, just the invisible hand of the free market.

Watch now as the band unionizes and plays “Trust-Busters.”

:sd[Band forms A Ghost! and plays “Ghostbusters.”]

Of course, the wicked witches of Wharton aren’t the only thing to be frightened of. Here are some more of the scariest things about Penn:

- A. It’s less than an hour away from New Jersey.
- B. There are nearly 40 frats and sororities, and 0 good parties.
- C. Their mascot. It’s just a guy.
- D. Unidentified Flying Objects in the stadium.
- E. Dick Wolf, and

Watch now as the band BOO! and plays “Brown Screaming Song”

:sd[Band forms a B and plays “Brown Cheering Song.”]

You just lost the game. Brown Band Out.
