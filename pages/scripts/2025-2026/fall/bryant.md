::script-note[The Band did not go to this game, but we wrote this script before that decision was made. Enjoy, so this perfectly good script doesn't go to waste! -EN]
## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is a redundant organization, it’s the Brown University “Knowledge, Character, Success, The Character Of Success, The Knowledge Of Character” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

The best part about being in a small state is that it’s easy to be the best at something! For example, Bryant can say they’re the best college in Rhode Island! No? Best college in Rhode Island that starts with a B! No? Best college in Rhode Island that’s used Fulton Recital Hall?... Yeesh.

Watch now as the Band rises the ranks and plays Bryant B. Mid.

:sd[Band forms X and plays Johnny B. Goode.]

We’ve talked about what Bryant isn’t, now let’s talk about what Bryant is. Bryant is a hub of “innovation and agility with purpose,” a phrase which sounds very cool and we’re sure means something. A Bryant education prepares students for important real-world experiences, such as working at Fidelity, working at Fidelity, and of course, working at Fidelity.

Watch now as the band does some consulting and plays Bryant Cheering Song.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays #2.]

Catch us at halftime when we forget what school we’re playing.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that left its soul on the MBTA, it’s the Brown University “get commuter rail’d” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Bryant’s finally come back from the 90’s! That $1 in the treasury has sure grown into an impressive endowment. We, as a small growing organization, want to take notes from Bryant’s success. Where did this money come from? Laundry? I’m sure that money must’ve been quite clean! 

Watch now as the band rolls the dice and plays “Poker Face.”

:sd[Band forms X and plays “Poker Face”.]

With Georgetown joining D1, we think three bulldog mascots is too many! In case they’re thinking of retiring Tupper II, here are a few alternatives:

:::script-list 

- A. A bear. I mean, we don’t have too many of those, right?
- B. A beer. If it works for Dartmouth!
- C. A talking white labrador. Families love labs, and this mascot would be a real family guy!
- D. Tupper I. The cycle will continue endlessly.
- E. The Fidelity logo. And
- F. The Princeton Band!

Watch now as the band prepares for the arrival of Tupper III and plays Everytime We Tup.

:sd[Band forms X and plays Everytime We Touch.]

Bryant, look out! Brown Band Out.
