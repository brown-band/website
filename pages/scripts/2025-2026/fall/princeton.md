## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s suddenly a lot larger than usual, it’s the Brown University “We can pass ‘em off as college students, right?” band.

What is a parent? What is a child? Are we all just children of the universe? Or parents of the band? Or Bands of the universe?... Where are we?

Watch now as the band goes out to get milk and plays “When You Coming Home, Mom?”

:sd[Band forms The Milky Way and plays “Stacy’s Mom.”]

Princeton, we’re disappointed in you. You literally stick your heads out of a window and howl twice a year, and you couldn’t get any furries on the design team for your mascot? No wonder there isn’t a Mrs. Princeton Tiger any more. Here, we’ve scouted out a list of your competition. 

:::script-list 

- A. Tony the Tiger (duh)
- B. Tigress (Kung Fu Panda) 
- C. Vitaly (Madagascar 3) 
- D. Shere Khan (Jungle Book)  
- E. That one tiger from Zootopia 
- F. The Princeton band!?

Watch now as the band lets go of the Tiger’s tail and plays “He Don’t Get Around.”

:sd[Band forms Lips and plays I Get Around.]

We’ve decided to adopt some of Princeton’s proud, long-standing traditions! At the beginning of this year, we had all new band members stand before our newly formed Honor Committee and swear to never play louder or faster than the conductor asks us to. On an unrelated note, all of our percussionists are currently under investigation.

Watch now as the band totally doesn’t rush and plays “Loud Speeding Song.”

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Brown Cheering Song.]

What’s new, pussycat? Brown Band Out.
