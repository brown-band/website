## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that still remembers the dark ages (but not for long), it’s the Brown University “this wouldn't have happened when I was on band board” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Time calls for us all eventually. Y’know this whole football thing is a lot harder than it looks for us aging seniors. First, we have to wake up at the unreasonably late time of 8 am just to make it to Fulton, and by then half the day is gone. Then, we have to march all the way to the stadium, and sit all day out in the cold. By the end, it's usually 4:30, or as we like to call it, Bed Time!

Watch now as the band retires to suburbia and plays “Through the Bingo Games”

Rhode Island has run out of room, so we’re off to explore the world! Here’s a few destinations we have in mind!

:::script-list

- A. The GCB
- B. The crushing monotony of the corporate world
- C. The Wild Colonial
- D. Back to our parents’ house
- E. The Malted Barley (bring back band trivia nights!) and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band faces its worst fear and plays “Every Application We Fill.”

Thank you for a great four years! Catch us at halftime when we get jobs at Lockheed-Martin.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves its senior citizens, it’s the Brown University “it’s not a problem til you graduate” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We know this is everyone’s most anticipated game of the year and fans want one thing and one thing only…THE BROWN BAND!!! Well, we’ve heard the cries of our adoring fans and decided to give them exactly what they asked for. But before we get into our jaw dropping performance we want to honor all 6 or 7 of our fabulous seniors with… rhyme!!!

:sd[Band forms a Champagne flute and plays Bits and Pieces.]

There once was a prez from R.I.\
Mike they always make cry\
Though we all yell ‘CHUNC’\
They get us out of a funk \
And never leave us high and dry.

There once was a corsec named George\
Who went by the nickname of “George”\
He looks like a George\
He sounds like a George\
And we’ll always know him as “Georgeous”

There once was a true New York Native \
Who loved nothing more than to be sedated\
From ol’ Frankly Wines\
To the Dartmouth Pines \
His flask was heavily weighted

The money god from board of old old old\
That Canadian man’s never cold\
He’s quite the ice skater\
And a money god by nature\
His love for the band is always bold

Topology, algebra, numbers\
I swear that the man never slumbers\
Have you seen his reels? \
They hit you in the feels \
We hate to see him put asunder

The bandie with the best attendance;\
The recsec with the longest remembrance.\
A Swiftie at heart\
From jazz she’ll never part\
Her BDH articles stupendous

While regulars may think “Who is she”\
Meredith fills our ears with much glee\
She kills all her flies\
And is mean ‘til you cry\
But for that at band she must be

A most passionate cymbalist \
With her hands she is the nimblest\
Creating lovely crafts \
Even better than photographs \
The engineer whose music is the loveliest

Ahhhh, the sheep of Hanover. They really make me kneel over. Speaking of over, we really can’t believe football season is almost complete. There’s so many forms we have yet to create. So many songs we have yet to play? What are we to do? Watch now as the band plays Everything Everywhere all at once

:sd[Band plays their favorite song in their favorite form.]

::script-note[We had a lot of extra time, so we played _Joshua_ and _Through the Fire and the Flames_ after about a minute of favorite song favorite form because the conductors and Karen didn't want to end with chaos (for reasons unknown to myself) -EN]

Catch us next year with a new crop of seniors to send to the Great Football Field in the Sky. Brown Band out!
