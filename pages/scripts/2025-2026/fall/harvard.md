## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has very strong opinions on long snappers, it’s the Brown University “Yeah, well, you know, uh, it’s an interesting conversation” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Harvard! It’s good to be back—we’ve missed its homely concrete walls and U-shaped architecture. Really makes you feel welcome. Do you know what else is u-shaped? The arc of a long snap! Well, we think. We at the Brown Band don’t know much about football. We did hear one thing though. Something about an upcoming 13-year winning streak for Brown football? We can’t wait to see it!

Watch now as the band crosses its fingers and plays “Beat ‘em”.

:sd[Band forms “four leaf clover” and plays “Beat It.”]

Now we’d like to take a moment to shout out one of Harvard’s most distinguished graduates, a legacy even, who’s given us some serious brainworms. He’s made a name for himself as a trailblazing environmental lawyer, and we’re glad he dragged these bears to Cambridge instead of Central Park. No idea what he’s been up to lately, but we’re sure it’s good! Nothing bad happens to the Kennedys, right?

Watch now as the band gets inside your head and plays “Doctor, More Worms!”

:sd[Band forms “a brain” and plays “Doctor Worm.”]

All these amazing people have gone to Harvard, but why should _you_ go to Harvard? Others may speak of Harvard’s name recognition or its rigorous academic programs, but we tell you this: You can get married on campus! Forget Vegas weddings, I’m having a Cambridge wedding.

Watch now as the band walks down the aisle and plays “Here Comes the Bride.”

:sd[Band forms a B and plays “Brown Cheering Song.”]

Catch us at halftime when we drone on and on.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s wasted many evenings with Tom Lehrer, it’s the Brown University “Poisoning Pilgrims in the Park” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

You can find all sorts of things in Harvard faculty’s laboratories, not all of them pleasant. Old Professor Webster may have found his money troubles rather disarming, but his creditor shouldn’t have lost his head over it. Do you know how much the cost of living was back in the 1800s? An arm and a leg! It just burns a person up, you know?

Watch now as the band goes out on a limb and plays “Dismember.”

:sd[Band forms “foot” and plays “September.”]

Harvard has way too many alumni to all make fun of in one script. What if we fused all Harvard students together into one person? Here’s what we think they would be like:

::: script-list

- A. Very, very, very affluent
- B. Older than calculus, and about as derivative
- C. Ahlways tahking about pahking cahs
- D. Antisocial despite starting The Social Network
- E. Transferred to law school from UCLA–what, like it’s hard?
- F. The Princeton Band

:::

At last, our scientific masterpiece is complete! Watch now as the band gets charged with unethical human experimentation and plays “Shipping Out of Boston.”

:sd[Band forms “a boat” and plays “Shipping Up to Boston.”]

Heater bugs would’ve been a better mascot! Brown Band Out.
