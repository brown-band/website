## Pregame 
Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that didn’t Jack their mascot from another school, it’s the Brown University (_Vampire voice_) “Three bulldogs, ah-ah-ah!” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Ah, good ol’ Georgetown University. A school of faith and spirituality, located right near the staircase where a certain priest took a tumble down–a situation most residents of DC find themselves in on a daily basis. It’s a good thing that Georgetown students have such spiritual guidance, as they are beset by all manner of demons such as “the rats in the dorms” and “the designers of the Washington Metro.”

Watch now as the band gets lost on the red line and plays “Tenleytown.”

:sd[Band forms “The D.C metro system” and plays Funky Town.]

The Band has found itself in hot water. Something about traffic cones? Who knows, we didn’t read the summons. To represent us, we’ve hired Georgetown’s greatest legal mind, Chuck McGill. He’s told us that we’re in great hands, and not to worry about the questionable bags his brother left in our closet. This is gonna be open and shut, no chicanery whatsoever!

Watch now as the band cooks its books and plays “Not Mobsters.”

:sd[Band forms “a gavel” and plays Rock Lobster]

Maybe the sketchy brother wasn’t the best way to go…The Band is now under investigation by the Central Intelligence Agency. Something about our polos causing a “Red Scare.” We won’t be able to prove whatever happens to us now, but don’t worry, it’ll probably be declassified twenty years down the line. 

Watch now as the band establishes a proxy government and plays “Party in the CIA.”

:sd[Band forms “Chile” and plays “Party in the USA”.]

Catch us at halftime when we organize a false flag operation.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that did not play the saxophone with that woman, it’s the Brown University “That depends on what the definition of the word ‘music’ is” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

The Band has had a great summer away experimenting in England, and we’re ready to get back to our studies. Georgetown’s known for its great political programs, producing such lauded figures as “the king of Spain” and “your future HOA president” . . . oh, yeah, and some guy named Bill. Wonder what he got up to after graduating?

Watch now as the band tints its windows and plays “The Impeachment That I Get.”

:sd[Band forms “a peach” and plays The Impression That I Get.]

There’s many things to celebrate about living in DC for college. For example, “not being in Ithaca” or “not being in Philadelphia.” We’d love to come see what life is like down there—all the sights to see, all the student interns to pass by. Unfortunately, no one in the band wanted to take an eight-hour bus ride. Maybe we’ll come by next year, though! 3 AM call time, anyone?

Watch now as the band develops chronic insomnia and plays “Awake Too Long Song.”

:sd[Band forms a “Crescent moon” and plays Ding Dong Song.]

Georgetown’s had a big impact on American history, and as they say, history is mystery. Here are some of the biggest mysteries in Georgetown’s history:

::: script-list

- A. How they managed to forget the date of their own founding
- B. Why does George get his own town?
- C. Who’s really buried in the Tombs
- D. Why people still want to join the Chimes–imagine having an acapella group on campus
- E. The prurient interests of the guy who sculpted the bulldog statue
- F. The Princeton Band 

:::

Fortunately, we’re more adept at sniffing out answers than all the bulldog mascots combined! Watch now as the band (_Barking noises_) and plays “For Bruno and For Bones.”

:sd[Band forms a B and plays #4.]

Hoya Nutas. Brown Band out.
