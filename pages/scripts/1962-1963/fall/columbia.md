Introducing the Brown University Marching Band, Martin Fischer, Director, Dennis Wyckoff, Drum Major.

:sd[Bend marches to midfield on “S.I.B.A.”]

We have long been aware of the current trend in motion pictures. Such contemporary films as “Lady Chatterly’s Lover,” “Lolita,” and “The Virgin Spring” have one thing in common; ———— they can all be set to music.

:sd[Band jumps to bush formation.]

We now take you to the set of “Lady Chatterly’s Lover.” You will notice that the band has formed a bush in anticipation of the next scene.

:sd[Band plays “I’ll be Seeing You in all the Old Familiar Places” and jumps into heart formation.]

The recent rise in popularity of child actresses prompts the band to pay tribute to the sweet young starlet of the movie “Lotia.”

:sd[Band plays “Thank Heaven for Little Girls” and jumps into X formation.]

The band now salutes “The Virgin Spring.” In deference to the Rhode Island Censorship Board the conservative band can form only one appropriate formation.

:sd[Band plays ? and marches off the field to great applause.]
