Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants to unfreeze Walt Disney from carbonite, it’s the Brown University "I love you—" "I know!" BAAAANNNNDDDD!!

We in the Band sure love Disney movies. Growing up, one of our favorites was The Little Mermaid, in which a princess divorces her husband in order to grow a scaly tail and join her father in his palace under the sea. Another gem is Aladdin, a gripping feature that describes the tragic fall of a king who loses his wife, imprisons a genie, and goes to work for a monkey. Then there’s Mulan, a touching story about a tough-as-nails soldier who sheds his armor to become the geisha he was always meant to be. Wait a minute, we’ve just been informed that we were watching them backwards our entire lives. Watch now as the Band forms Mulan’s Pillar and Weights and plays I’ll Make a Man Out of You.

In light of Disney’s recent acquisition of LucasFilm’s popular "Star Wars" franchise, we created a brain trust to decide which franchises Disney should take over. Here were the top five films that we’d want to see Disney-fied...

:::script-list

- a) The Fast and the Furious;
- b) Ocean’s Eleven;
- c) The Fifty Shades Trilogy;
- d) The Godfather;
- e) Saw; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!!

When I was a young warthog... Sha-la-la-la-la-la my-oh-my. I can show you the world! Hi, ho. You ain’t never had a friend never had a friend, you ain’t never had a friend never had a friend, you ain’t never, had a, friend, like, meeeee! :sd[Cantina band] Someday, my prince will come! Let’s get down to business—I can go the distance. Be our guest. You want thingamabobs? I got twenty! For a handsome sturdy husband, who builds handsome sturdy walls, who never dreams that something might be coming... I’m especially good at expectorating! But none of them will ever love you the way I do. You’ve gotta dig a little deeper. A square with a horn makes you wish you weren’t born every time he plays. And we’ll kick their rear! Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can!

Wow, I don’t know about you, but I think we’ve just done some serious Imagineering. Come back on February 9th as the Brown Band and our Fabulous Alumni put on a second ice show and, oh yeah, our Men’s Hockey team takes on the Fightin’ Yales! If you enjoyed this ice show, it’ll be twice as good when the alums come back to play. See you on the flipside!
