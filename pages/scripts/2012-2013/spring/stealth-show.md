Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that got tired of shaking its ass after the first thirty minutes, it’s the Brown University “That’ll do, Big Freedia, that’ll do” BAAANNNNNDDDD!

So the Brown Band drank “all the alcohol,” was at a LAN party, did homework at Dave Binder, got baked, baked brownies, became baked Brownies, offered advice for 5 cents, lost a softball game, lost board games, got locked in a Providence College dorm, made a classy brunch, dunked Fiery Cushman, silently raved, was Fratty in the Ratty, did the Hokey Pokey, and was Dennis. I heard there was a concert this weekend or something? Watch now as the Band struggles to make it to their 9-am class on Monday morning and plays “Bake Me Up Before You Go-Go.”

Hey, did everyone hear about that fire in Keeney? Those foolish freshmen! Setting things on fire is for upperclassmen! Wait ’till you’re older, kiddos. But we’re all curious—how did the fire happen?

Watch now as the Band tries to get all of that fire-extinguisher stuff off their clothes and plays “Come On, Keeney.”

Speaking of finals...\
_I will not take them in a box.\
I will not take them with a fox\
I will not take them in a house\
I will not take them with a mouse\
I will not take them here or there.\
I will not take them anywhere.\
I will not take my final exam.\
I will not take it, Sam-I-am._

Whoops, we just blatantly stole from Doctor Seuss! Man, was that guy a huge racist. Looks like it’s time to make a hasty exit and skedaddle. You’ll find us at the Women’s Lacrosse game this weekend and at Commencement at the end of May. Then it’s time to take a break for summer. Stay classy, Brown! Brown Band OUT.
