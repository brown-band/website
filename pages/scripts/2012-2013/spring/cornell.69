Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's willfully ignorant,
it's the Brown University "Upstate New York is Canada, Eh??" BAAANNNDDDD.
</sp>

Dear viewers, did that Cornell University is an exclave of Canada? It's ruled by Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth II, Governor General David Lloyd Johnson, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and
has an affinity for making maple syrup. The official languages spoken at Cornell are English,
French, and Bovine, and they love universal healthcare but hate pennies and making decisions.
For those of you who wish to study engineering at Cornell, you'll need to learn the Canadian numbering
system: loony, toon-y, trois, quatre, and five. If you ever want to visit Ithaca, make sure you hold
a valid U.S. passport, because you don't want those mounties to mount<smdash/>I mean arrest you. Watch now as
the band forms the national herb of Canada and plays Cornell's Alma Mater.

So we don't know if you guys remember, but we were supposed to have an alumni ice show a couple of weeks
ago... and then Nemo found Providence. Therefore, we're going to keep making alumni jokes until they become
relevant again. Here's a list of famous people who went to Cornell at one point, but realized their mistake
and dropped out.

<sli>a)	The Wizard of Oz;</sli>
<sli>b)	Kurt Vonnegut;</sli>
<sli>c)	Huey Lewis;</sli>
<sli>d)	And his band The News;</sli>
<sli>e)	Harry Chapin; and</sli>
<sli>f)	THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

Wow, maybe all of these people just hated going to school in Canada. They wanted to keep their talents in
the good ol' U-S-of-A. Watch now as the band forms Cornell's McGraw Bell Tower and plays "Karn Evil."

Yo guys, we heard you like it when we ice skate. So we're gonna do some of that for you right now. You know
who doesn't ice skate? The Cornell Band... and that's because the Brown Band is the world's best and only ice
skating scramble band. *Band yells: shameless self promotion!* The Brown Band is so great, all of our students
will one day win Nobel Peace Prizes. Also, Ann Coulter went to Cornell.  Every rose has its thorn.

Wow, all of our ice shows have come and gone; we're going to try our hardest not to cry. However, that doesn't
mean that the band is going anywhere<smdash/>you can still see us at many other hockey (and basketball) games to come.
Shout out to the Class of 2013<smdash/>you guys rock<smdash/>and also shout out to the whole band for being awesome. See you later,
alligator... football season is only six months away!
