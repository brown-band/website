Ladies and Gentlemen, prospective friends and prospective alumni, presenting an organization that expects all of you to join it, it’s the Brown University “SHAMELESS SELF PROMOTION” Baaannnnnnnddddd!!!!

Sup, babies? Our name’s Slim Shady. Actually, do you even know who Slim Shady is? Or was he before your time? Let’s do the math. You’re going to be the class of 2017, which means that y’all would have been NINE YEARS OLD when the song “My Band” by D-12 was first released. And THAT MEANS that you were only EIGHT YEARS OLD when “Finding Nemo” was released. Geez , way to make us feel old! When we were your age, Pluto was still a planet! But that’s okay—we’re here to teach you your ABC’s, easy as 1-2-3, as simple as S/NC, ABC... that’s Brown’s grading system! That’s right—you take classes pass/fail here. And there aren’t even core requirements! Why would you go anywhere but Brown? Watch now as the Band forms Bottocelli’s “Birth of Venus” and plays “Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.”

Remember those kids who went to the “weird” preschool that didn’t have any rules? Well, we’re that kind of college. Hello, pre-frosh, look at other colleges, now back to Brown, now back at other colleges, now back to Brown. Sadly, they aren’t Brown, but if they stopped using ladies scented body wash and switched to Old Spice, they could smell like Brown. Look down, back up, where are you? You’re at Brown with the people your friends will look like (shout out to Hayley Siegel and Charlie Gleason). What’s in your hand, back at Brown. Brown has it, it’s the best four years of your life so far with two tickets to that thing you love. Look again, the tickets are now diamonds. Anything is possible when you attend Brown University and not a lady. Brown’s on a hill. Go to college, man. Brown.

If none of this made sense to you, come to Brown in the fall and we’ll explain it to you. If all of this made sense to you, come to Brown in the fall and join the Band. In short, come to Brown because it’s great, and you might be too... if you come to Brown. Brown Band OUT.
