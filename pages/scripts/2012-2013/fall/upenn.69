Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that'll let you have
whatever you like, it's the Brown University "~~~StAcKs On DeCk, PaTrOn On IcE~~~" BAAAANNNDDD!

We're somewhat kinda not really excited to be in the grand City of Brotherly Love and to play
an exciting game against Penn State! I meant the University of Pittsburgh! I meant the University
of Pennsylvania, the finest public university in all the Philly Cheesesteak-covered land of Philadelphia!
</sp>
<sp>
From someplace better I was born and raised/<sbr/>
In Providence is where I spend most of my days/<sbr/>
Chilling, relaxing, and being oh so cool/<sbr/>
Cause I know I play for a much better school/<sbr/>
When a couple of Penn students up to no good/<sbr/>
Had us come down to their neighborhood/<sbr/>
One little scandal in the area and everyone got scared/<sbr/>
They said, "Get back to Rhode Island far away from here!"

I pulled up to the Van Wickle Gates about 7 or 8/<sbr/>
And I told the bus driver, "Thanks man, see ya later,"/<sbr/>
I took a look at my school and was relieved I was there/<sbr/>
Back to Brown University and Bruno the Bear.

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that used to have binders full
of women, it's the Brown University "Middle School Was A Weird Time" BAAANNNDDD!

Back in the day, I used to have a Trapper-Keeper stuffed full of women. Unfortunately, Barack Obama
bullied me as I minded my own business, clinging to my guns and religion. You think it would be
enough for him to take my lunch money, but no, he ripped my composition notebook full of females
out of my hands. The ladies fled into the wild, and I never saw any of them again. That's why I'm
voting for Ron Swanson this November. Watch now as the Band attempts to Triforce and plays "Legend of Zelda."

Confused yet? Here's a list. Benjamin "It's All About the Hamiltons, Baby!" Frankenweenie founded your
university and invented some jawns. We don't know what jawns he did invent, so we're gonna brainstorm some right now:

<sli>a)	Fingerless gloves;</sli>
<sli>b)	The Franklin-Boson particle;</sli>
<sli>c)	Sexting;</sli>
<sli>d)	4chan;</sli>
<sli>e)	Hunting and gathering; and</sli>
<sli>f)	THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

<sp>
Wow, we really brought the victory on this one! Sadly, we got distracted by all these Quaking Shakers
and turned away from our Faith in the Lord. Looks like we'll have to make up for it with some Hail Marys
and Our Fathers next week when we return to Providence and take on the Fightin' Yales. It'll be one humdinger
of a time! Catch you later!
