## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that enjoys a good sit, it’s the Brown University “Come and Take a Load Off!” BAAANNNNDDDD!

If you’re standing right now, you might want to sit down. Things are about to get crazy. He’s my very own Christian Grey-flavor popsicle. Hmm... he’s soft and hard at once, like steel incased in Brown, and surprisingly tasty... This is wrong, but holy hell is it Brown. Some Boy Scout he must have been to learn these knots! I don’t remember reading about Brown clamps in the Bible. Why is anyone the way they are? That’s kind of hard to answer. Why do some people like cheese and other people hate it? Do you like cheese?

Boy, that was sure erotic! We’ve never been more turned on in our lives! Good thing we’re sitting down. In case you didn’t get it earlier, here are FIVE SHADES OF BROWN.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s not a woman, per se... it’s the Brown University “Thatcher? I hardly know ‘er!” BAAANNNDD!

Little known fact—before the Iron Lady was known as The Iron Lady, she was known as The Grocer’s Daughter. Interestingly, before the Big Green was known as The Big Green, it was known as the Iron Keggy. The evil mascot Keggy ruled Hanover with an “aluminium” fist, and all the students were miserable. Thankfully, the students decided to fight the good fight and appropriated The Keg for their own uses. The rich tradition of drinking alone on Tuesday Afternoons continues to this day, throughout sad, dark dorm rooms on Dartmouth’s campus. Thus, while the Iron Keggy was vanquished, his evil legacy lives on.

Oh, you’re curious about Iron Keggy’s origins? That’s dumb, you silly dirty double crossing snake greasing goat sucker, but we’ll tell you anyway. Once upon a time, Santa Claus fell in love with the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz. Because of the intense bias against marriages between imaginary characters, the two could not wed. They also didn’t want a civil union because they were too lazy to go to the Oz Courthouse and stand in line. As such, they lived out their days in a log cabin a la Henry David Thoreau, and Keggy was born. :sd[spoken seriously] We’re off to see “The Wizard.” The “Wonderful Wizard of Oz.”

:sd[Band forms whatever the hell they want and makes noise.]

Oh no—breaking tragic news! In last Tuesday’s festivities, known as Keg’s Day after the famous Iron Keggy, a freshman thought he knew what he was doing and tried to shotgun a glass bottle. Because he was alone, there was nobody else to call 9-1-1. In summation, he perished. The world wept. Watch now as the Band honors his memory by doing the most difficult thing it ever does and the trombones do the most difficult thing they’ve never done. Brace yo’selves.

:sd[Band forms a B, plays “In the Fray,” and countermarches.]

We’re still hot and bothered from our pregame show, so we decided to go a-searchin’ in the Bible for those Brown clamps. Hopefully we don’t get left behind if the Rapture occurs; we’re not sure we can handle the postapocalyptic hellscape that is Hanover, NH. Come back to Providence with us as we close out our football season and take on the Los Bogotas Combatas! Where? We don’t know either. Peace out cub scouts!
