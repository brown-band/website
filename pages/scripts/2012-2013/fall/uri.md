## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that knows it's notthe size of the thought, it's how you use it, it's the Brown University "Think Big? We Are!" BAAAAAANNNNNDDDD!

Welcome one and all to the famed URI vs. Brown game, where two teams fight valiantly for the Governor's Cup. Last year, Brown won the Cup and sang its victory from the high heavens. The Brown Band got to tour with the Cup, ensuring that even the remotest of locations would know of Brown's football prowess. Our favorite stop on the victory tour was Shangri-La, though we have to admit that some of us had trouble climbing the Himalayans. Our least favorite stop was New Jersey, because Governor Chris Christie almost ate the Cup. Thank goodness our governor would never try and do anything like that!

In recent news, a gifted URI student decided to teach small children about even smaller technology—nanotechology, to be exact—by creating a Lego-based atomic-force microscope. We in the Brown Band think that's really impressive, so we decided to emulate this esteemed undergrad and build our own cool things out of Legos! Here's what we came up with:

:::script-list

- a) A scale model of the Large-Hadron collider;
- b) A replica of the Governor's Cup as a consolation prize;
- c) A hammer of justice;
- d) The hanging gardens of Babylon;
- e) Frankenstein's monster; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!!

By this point in our college careers, we Brunonians are Providence experts. We know it so well that we could practically give tours of the city. We'd like to get to know the entire Great State of Rhode Island, though, so we figured we'd come hang out in Kingston. When we asked for directions to Waterfire, we were shown an oily puddle that had caught aflame. In searching for the mall, we found the Kingston General Store and bough some coffee milk. We really enjoyed the bustling metropolis, but were relieved to get back to the familiar small-town comfort of Providence.

Awww fiddlesticks, looks like we didn't confess our sins for missing the Georgetown game. We'll have to try again next week! Bruno fans, it's another away game as everybody's favorite Brown Bears brave the Jersey Turnpike to take on the Fightin' Princetons! Hope to see you there and smell ya later!
