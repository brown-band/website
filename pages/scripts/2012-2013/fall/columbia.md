## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has absolutely no knowledge of copyright laws, it’s the Brown University “Theeeeeeeeeeeey’re Great!” Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand!

The Disney Corporation has let us in on the fact that the Star Wars prequel trilogy was a schizophrenic nightmare brought on by continuous blunt force trauma to the head. As such the sequel trilogy will star Sylvester Stallone as Luke “The Italian Stallion” Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princess Ladrian Organa and James Earl Jones as the posthumous voice of Darth Apollo Creed. Unfortunately Han “Cut me Mick” Solo and Chew “Chewie” Bacca split when Chewie declared himself a New York Giants fan. Watch now as the band forms Smaug and plays Isaacs’s other favorite song.

The film opens to find Luke awakening from his 20th concussion sustained while fighting Ivan “The Rancor” Drago, Emperor of Fisticuffs. In a surprising turn of events, he is informed by C3 “Get the Pizzas” P0 that he is Ladrian’s only hope. And in a heartwarming sub-plot, R2 “Paulie Badabing” D2 tries to learn American Sign Language. Watch now as the band gives this movie a better rating that Roger Ebert did and wins.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s pretty sure you missed a few graduation requirements, it’s the Brown University “never leave us!” BAAANNNNDDDD!

_Without Wilson there is no Band.\
We’re lucky for his helping hand!\
He picks up the slack,\
Even with his bad back.\
He is the best Baer in the land!_

_There once was a man named Jeff Blum\
This year, he’s kind of an alum.\
He read every script,\
And the Bonesaw equipped\
When he is gone we’ll be glum.We have this good friend named Jon Cox:\
This senior is one stone cold fox.\
He plays the trombone\
With really good tone.\
Knock knock, this jock rocks our socks._

_We love this dude named Danny Gleave\
We’re already preparing to grieve\
When he goes away\
We’ll cry every day\
What the hell will he do when he leaves?_

_Our friend Isaac is on his way out\
When he leaves we will all start to pout\
At his last hockey game\
He rose to great fame\
For “Vehicle” thrice did he shout_

_There’s this grandmother named Michelle Graff\
She has a melodious laugh\
She’s a slothy C-net\
We will never forget\
For she was a mom and a half_

_Our oh so fertile Bguest\
Who always plays sousa the best\
Drinkin forties by the bottle\
What a great role model\
He upholds traditions with zest_

_Dear Steven’s a huge fan of bacon\
His love for cars he ain’t fakin\
He plays snare so loud\
It makes us real proud\
For the Princeton band he’s always achin’_

_To Joanna, our beloved conductor\
In the band hall of fame we’d induct her\
We gave her a plaque\
Cuz we all want her back\
If she were single we def would’ve **hugged** her_

_There once was a bandie named 'Nyah\
Who played bari sax without flaw\
In France she did study\
We missed our **hug**buddy\
So Voulez Vous Couchez avec moi?_

_Jenny Steger is just way too cute!\
She plays clarinet, not the flute.\
She loves tiny creatures,\
Has beautiful features,\
And is such a smartie to boot!_

_Oh how we’ll miss our Nawal\
Without her the trumpets would fall\
She knows Descartes and Plato\
And the workings of NATO\
She’s certainly beloved by all._

We hope you enjoyed this football season as much as we did, but unfortunately we were too focused on gaping paternal plot holes and completely disregarded the Immaculate Conception. But come out and support the Brown Bears in all the Winter Sports and watch us try to declare a War on Christmas. That’s all folks!
