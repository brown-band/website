## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has no idea how to build an ark, it’s the Brown University "What the hell is a cubit?!" BAAANNNNDD!

This past Monday, we committed a pretty egregious error—after doing our laundry, we left our clothes out to dry... and then Hurricane Sandy descended upon Providence. Luckily, we don’t need clothes to attend Brown’s annual "SexPowerGod" party that’s taking place tonight. In past years, people have shown up dressed as Sexy Inspector Gadget, Sultry Powerpuff Girls, and Voluptuous Ice Climbers, to name a few. In celebration of Saturday’s event, watch now as the band forms Sexy Sandra Dee and plays "Sexy Sir Duke."

When people post lists on the Internet ad other places that have lists, everyone skips reading the intro, so lets just get to it. Here’s a list somehow tangentially related to something at Brown.

:::script-list

- a) Spheno Palatine Gangleoneuralgia;
- b) Society for the Propagation of Gospel in Foreign Parts;
- c) Slumber Party Girls;
- d) Starwoods Preferred Guests;
- e) Salaciously Pontificating Gerbils; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s not going to waste its vote on Roseanne Barr, it’s the Brown University "We’re Stickin’ with Alf Instead!" BAAANNNNDDD!

We’re sure that by now everyone is familiar with Republican Candidate Willard Mittens "Two Thumbs Up" Cheeseman the Third, I mean... Romney... and his five-point economic plan. The Band has been inspired by this brilliance and has decided to create a plan of our own that will outline this current halftime show.

:::script-list

- a) Play some music and make some forms;
- b) Figure out what Willard "Et Cetera" Romney’s plan is;
- c) Bang out with our thaaaaaang out;
- d) Make North America "energy independent" by 2020;
- e) I’m pretty sure that’s more points than the GOP has given us; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!

Watch now as the band enacts this plan and plays "By the Way, That Plan Had Six Points!"

:sd[Band forms five points and plays "Through the Fire and Flames."]

Because this five point plan was much more elusive than a Chupacabra wearing an invisibility cloak in Woonsocket, RI, we’re votin’ for the other guy... William Jennings Bryan. Seriously. You should do it too. After all, he’s bound to get elected eventually. Watch now the Band forms the Scopes-Monkey Trial and plays "I Want Silver Back."

We’re not going to talk about That University in New Haven because they smell bad and Brown is clearly superior. We’ve heard that over yonder in Thither Westward Connecticut, a man sexually assaulted a horse one time... that would never happen in Providence! Also, a lineman on their football team who graduated in 2012 tried to cast one hundred fraudulent ballots—Alex Tounkara-Kone ’11.5 and Kyle Newhall-Caballero ’11.5 would never do that! Also, we’re not going to talk about them because Handsome Dan has no opposable thumbs. At least our mascot is an anthropomorphized bear!

:sd[Band forms a B and plays "Brown Threevermore."]

We were planning on attending High Mass at the Woonsocket Parish when suddenly the Chupacabra showed up and we skedaddled. We’ll renew our faith next week as we climb the mountains of New Frozenwasteland and taken on the Fightin’ Dart-mouths. And with that, two and a half years of script reading come to a glorious close. I hope you’ve all enjoyed it as much as I have, and thanks for the memories. Best of luck to the next Voice of the Brown Band, and for the last time, see you on the flipside.
