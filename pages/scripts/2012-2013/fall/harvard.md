## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that didn’t offend the Catholic Church last week, it’s the Brown University “Better Make Up for it Now!” BAANNNDDD!

This past week on the hit NBC show “The Voice,” one of the spinning chair’s motors malfunctioned, resulting in the tragic death of Cee-Lo Green. In the ensuing explosion, six audience members were gravely injured. Thankfully, Blake Shelton emerged from the chaos unscathed as he dove for cover under Christina Aguilera’s derriere. In light of vacancy left by Cee-Lo, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is now a new judge. Watch as the Band forms the NBC Peacock and plays a tribute to the Armpit of America’s Favorite Governor.

It’s been a bit of a rough week for NBC, as there was also an incident on its show “Stars Earn Stripes.” In a freak obstacle course accident, D-list actor Carrot Top was snatched up by North Korean Spies and taken out of the country. Authorities are uncertain as to how he escaped his maximum-security playpen at Mohegan Sun Connecticut. As of yet, no efforts have been to retrieve him, though extensive attempts have been made on North Korea’s part to try and give him back. Watch now as the Band tries to foster diplomacy.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that passed “Introduction to Congress” on their own, it’s the Brown University “CHEATERS NEVER PROSPER!” BAAAANNNNNNDDDD!

In case you were living under a rock this summer, the esteemed higher education organization known as Hahvahd found themselves in a bit of hot water. Over 100 students in Professor Matthew B. Platt’s “Introduction to Congress” class were caught cheating on their final exam. Supposedly, the wave of cheating was brought on after the class’ difficulty level skyrocketed. It seems that, at Harvard, they teach you, “When the goin’ gets tough, the tough gets cheatin’.” The Brown Band does not condone this extremely illegal behavior. Watch now as the Band forms The Hammer of Justice and lets freedom ring.

According to our inside sources at Harvard, the final for “Introduction to Congress” was extremely difficult. We wanted to see if we could ace the class, so we took a stab at some of the hardest questions from the final...

:::script-list

- a) What are the names of the two Houses of Congress?
- b) Who is buried in Grant’s Tomb?
- c) How many senators does each state have?
- d) What was John C. Calhoun’s batting average?
- e) What’s the name of the Care Bear with the sun on its chest? And...
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!

We don’t know how you did, but we sure didn’t feel obligated to cheat! For once, all those hours watching Saturday morning cartoons came in handy. Watch now as the Band forms Funshine Bear and shares its feelings about cheating.

In a recent interview with Professor Platt and his teaching assistants, the Winklevoss Twins, he admitted that he was not mad, just disappointed. “I just don’t understand how they got the one about Funshine Bear wrong,” bemoaned Platt as he shook his head. Rumor has it that he’s applying for a position here at Brown, where he plans to offer his class mandatory S/NC. The silver lining of this whole ordeal is that the cheating may actually bolster Harvard students’ chances of becoming members of Congress. All we have to say is thank goodness we go to Brown.

We hope you’ve enjoyed our show... oh no! We forgot yet again to make fun of those wacky Papists. Good thing that Bruno goes to Georgetown next week—it’s too bad that we can’t make it. We’ll see you in two weeks at URI, as Bruno takes on the fightin’ URIes and maintains its control of the Governor’s Cup. Smell ya later!
