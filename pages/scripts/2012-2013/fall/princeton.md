## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just finished watching a marathon of those them there Pirates of the Caribbean movies, it’s the Brown University “That Was Kinda Weird, Now We’re Back In The Club” BAAAANNNNDDDD!

We heard a rumor that at a Six Flags New Jersey, a reckless ruffian fed a Doritos Locos Taco to an innocent giraffe in the safari portion of the park. We then decided to look for a reputable source on the web to find out if this was real, and, more importantly, if this giraffe was okay. This was the best response that the interwebz showed us: “New Jersey became the first state to legislatively abolish the death penalty...French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely.” Way to be New Jersey, way:script-tab to:script-tab be!

But New Jersey’s not all bad! It has turned out more than a few worthwhile people... like, you know... Christina Paxson. And Jon Stewart. And Bruce Springsteen... okay that’s about it. We’re glad that we’ve stolen away one third of Jersey’s natural resources. If Jon Stewart and Bruce Springsteen want to come hang out in Providence, we’re not complaining!

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that lives by New Jersey’s state motto, it’s the Brown University “He Who Smelt It Dealt It” BAAAAANNNNNDDDD!

Even though the Brown Band loves Rhode Island, we think that New Jersey is a pretty great place. It’s got elected officials who have “raised the bar” since the state’s inception. Unfortunately, there’s one bad seed who’s been asleep on the job, and by “seed” we mean Governor Chris Christie. Here are a bunch of things that other New Jerseyites have done that Good Ol’ GCC hasn’t:

:::script-list

- a) Saved people from a burning building;
- b) Not fallen asleep at a Bruce Springsteen concert;
- c) Had his body fat drop below 47%;
- d) Stolen a vehicle in Newark;
- e) Seen his own toes; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!

Come on, Chris, pick up the slack! Watch now as the band forms Chris Christie and plays a tribute to his time in office.

And now, a limerick written by William Shakespeare:\
_:script-tab “There once was a guv’nor named Chris\
:script-tab Whose roundness was quite hard to miss!\
:script-tab When rub-a-dub-dub\
:script-tab He got stuck in the tub!\
:script-tab How the heck will he get out of this?”_

Watch as the band explodes the bathtub to extract the Governor and plays “Come On, Christie!”

We’re going to be totally honest with you right now—the only reason we’re here is because an independent contractor hired us to follow Chris Christie around with a tuba. The tuba’s melodious oom-pah-pah provides a perfect soundtrack to the Governor’s everyday activities. Did a giraffe steal your Doritos Locos Taco? Have some tuba. Eating said giraffe to reclaim your taco? Sounds like you need a tuba. Stuck in a bathtub? Our tuba can sure help you out, but not out of the bathtub. If only our tuba could help improve Christie’s gubernatorial skills. Hire the Brown Band for all of your tuba needs!

Awww Jumpin’ Jesuits, we forgot again! I wonder if Holy Cross is getting offended. Oh well. Come back to Providence with us for our Family Weekend next week as the Brown Bears take on the Imposter Fightin’ Cornells. We’d make a joke about how they stole our mascot, but we’re classier than that. Enjoy your Saturday and see you on the flip side!
