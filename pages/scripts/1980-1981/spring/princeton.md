Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you tiger lilies, it’s the Brown University Band on the Rocks. :sd[During this and the following lines the band skates out into two angle brackets open in opposite directions.]

Tonight, in the city of Providence, all is calm. But, suddenly, a mysterious noxious fume pervades the air. We check the Providence River, we check the Princeton hockey team, and finally we find the source of this fatal fragrance, the Ratty. Here lurks an evil presence so foul, so pungent, so rancid, that it remains undistinguished from the usual Ratty fare. What is this sickening stench? It’s Artichoke Pasta Man, that doer of dastardly deeds, that lascivious liberator of linguini, that belligerent belcher of Beef Bourgignon.

Tonight Artichoke Pasta Man enters Alpha Chi Omega in search of new meatless dishes. There he comes upon our heroine, Lois Carmen Denominator, heiress of Max Factor and owner of the Hope Street Diamond.

Watch now as the band forms Lois’s jewel.

:sd[The band moves the two angle brackets towards each other and eventually forms a diamond. They play “Pink Panther.” While the band is doing this, Artichoke Pasta Man lurks around Lois, tries unsuccessfully to steal the diamond around her neck, and finally drags her off across the ice.]

Artichoke Pasta Man takes Lois to his ice palace. He turns the key in the lock of her box, and there keeps her prisoner.

:sd[The band changes the diamond into two plus signs. They play "Can-Can." Meanwhile, Arti and his dastardly doers, the sax section, entrap Lois in a prison made from the two hockey nets.]

Will Artichoke Pasta Man snatch Lois’s jewel? Will help arrive in time before he weighs her carats? Will Artichoke Pasta Man get fresh? Will he find a flaw in her structure? Will he fence the ice?

For the answers to these and other questions, tune in tomorrow night. Same Band time. Same Band station.

:sd[The band skates out of the plus signs into two parallel lines, which then skate off the ice in a criss-crossing diamond shaped helix.]
