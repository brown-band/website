Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you freshman mothers and fathers and their parents, it’s the Brown University Band for President.

In our usual magnanamous tradition of self interest, the band would like to propose the elimination of two time wasting events— non-Ivy football games and the November Presidential elections. This way we could get rid of two useless colleges, the electoral college and Holy Cross.

And now it’s time to play “Let’s Make a President.” Loretta Putz, of Belchertown, Mass., come on down!! You have been chosen to select the next President of the United States.

:sd[Band has formed three adjacent boxes with intervening spaces that look like doors from “Let’s Make a Deal.” At this point in the show, they play “Tijuana Taxi,” as a member of the audience comes running down from the stands onto the field.]

Well, Mrs. Putz, do you want the candidate behind Door Number 1, Door Number 2, or Door Number 3? You selected Door Number 2. Well, Jay, you fat tub of pig slime, why don’t you tell us what’s behind the doors she didn’t choose?

Thanks, Bob. If you had chosen Door Number 1, you would have received a 56 year old peanut farmer from Plains, Georgia. Retail value, according to a recent Rosalyn estimate, and adjusted for inflation, $5.23. And also, a year’s supply of Billy Beer. :sd[Door Number 1 changes to a smile.]

If you had selected Door Number 3, you would have received a 69 year old geriatric chimpanzee trainer with a rusty pacemaker. :sd[Door Number 1 changes to the number 69.] But you’ve chosen the Brown Band. :sd[Door Number 2 becomes a “B”]

Representing the keg party and running on a parking ticket, this candidate promises to eliminate unemployment, unless people don’t have jobs, eliminate air pollution from flowers and trees, and cut out all taxes except for money you give to the government. The band looks forward to its four year term and plays “Shaft.” :sd[Band plays “Theme from Shaft.”]

Turning from fears of the future to fears of the past, the band now offers some comforting words to the freshmen parents here today.

If you feared your little Suzy would start taking bad drugs, don’t worry; all the drugs here are great.

If you feared your little Tommy would get laid-off his job at the Ratty, don’t worry; it hasn’t happened to a freshman yet.

If you feared your son or daughter would become a drunk, well, don’t worry; since the drinking age has been raised to 19, your sons and daughters are now all felons.

If you feared that your daughter would get pregnant, there’s no need to worry. You can <u>rely</u> on Brown Health Services to provide protection. Developed by a child gynecologist, from the makers of Janitor in a Drum. Remember, they named it “Revenge.” The band salutes this new measure and plays “Can’t Can’t.”

:sd[The band forms something representing a tampon which swells as they play “Can Can.”]
