Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you freshmen newcomers, presenting the Brown University Matriculating Band.

:sd[Band runs out screaming. When they realize what is being said, they stop, stand around and yawn. When the announcer says “hot dog vendors,” they continue.]

We’d like to welcome, once again, what Jim Rogers describes as the most intelligent, most promising, most diverse, most select, most talented, most interesting, most exciting class of hot dog vendors this university has ever seen.

We know you’ve all spent sleepless nights this summer waiting for the first episode of <u>Dallas</u> to find out who shot J.R. Well, the band is here to tell you we don’t know and we don’t care. Instead we would like to present our OWN show, <u>Providence</u>. Who shot H.R. Swearer? Was it:

:::script-list

- a) Dean Harriet Sheridan, who is tired of her position and seeking revenge;
- b) Jim Rogers, who H.R. kept on the waiting list;
- c) The Ratty food, which is always suspect;
- d) Eli Yale, because Yale didn’t want Brown to have a president either; or
- f) The Princeton Band.

:sd[The band forms a cocked rifle, shoots itself off on the field, and plays “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.”]

The band strikes back with another new fall show about the trials and trivialities of a Brown freshman. Luke SciLi Walker, seeking knowledge to combat the evil Darth Grader, consults his faculty advisor Yoda.

> “Ratty it is called, not refectory, my SON. I.U.D is not a frat. Beware the barber, it is the dark side of the Faunce. SOC 5, my son, is a gut. From drinking you shall abstain if not the age of nineteen you have reached. Patience you must have. Sex, drugs, and Rock ’n’ Roll, a freshman craves not these things.”

:sd[The Band forms Leia Organa’s hair and plays “Star Wars.”]

Unsatisfied with the monochromatic fare of the new fall lineup we have offered, the select Brown frosh will no doubt turn his energy to more creative and constructive efforts such as playing “Space Invaders.” Watch now as the band wards off the incoming enemy and plays “Big Winnings.”

:sd[Band simulates the arcade game “Space Invaders” as they play “Beginnings.”]

Be back in two weeks when the band returns from hyperspace.

:sd[Band marches off on yard lines to “Ever True to Brown.”]
