Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you quaker oats, it’s the Brown University “We used Penn as a backup school” Band.

And now a word from our sponsor. Are you tired of sitting at home watching reruns of Petticoat Junction? Did you have an academic experience in high school? Did you attend the S.A.T.’s? Then do we have an offer for you. If you can hear this message, you can go the University of Pennsylvania and get a good job. Just send in fifteen boxtops from Captain Crunch Cereal. Order by midnight tonight and you’ll also receive a free copy of <u>How to Succeed at Penn Without Really Going</u>. Offer void where prohibited by intelligence.

The band distributes U. Penn diplomas and plays “Penn is No Heaven.”

And now back to our regularly scheduled show. The band would like to point cut that there’s a new erection on A.D. Field. This construction effort is actually the new athletic center, and not a RISD art project, and will include facilities for belly bucking, arm wrestling, and cock fighting. It will also have a practice field on the roof, which is welcome improvement to President Swearer’s suggestion of putting a practice field on the roof on Smith Swim Center. The band wrecks itself on the field and plays “Wide World of Sports.”

Turning from up shooting buildings to down pouring rains, the band calls your attention to the unusually dry skies. Why, rain for the Penn game is as traditional as Brown’s victory.

Continuing this tradition of tradition breaking, watch now as the band finally stops beating around the bushes and finally forms an actual, large, throbbing…

:sd[The band had just begun to move into a rather phallic formation, but stops when the next line starts.]

Band — This is your conscience speaking. What would your mother say if she saw you doing that? Now be a nice band and form something pretty.

The band forms a flower, salutes its own attempt at turning over a new leaf, and plays “Mission Impossible.”

:sd[The band forms a flower. During the song, the flower turns into a devil’s pitchfork.]

Be back in two weeks when we’ll show your parents how we do it.

:sd[The band leaves on yardlines playing “Ever True.”]
