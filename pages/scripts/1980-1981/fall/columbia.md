Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and flatulent felines, it’s the Brown University a vote for Carter is a vote for Reagan Band.

Today the band would like to pay tribute to a great city, New York,

- home of the most minor league, major league teams;
- home of many intelligent Ivy League students, when they’re home on vacation
- home of some of the best prep schools in the country.

Speaking of Columbia, the band would like to offer some suggested uses for your Columbia diploma. You could use it for:

The band salutes the greatest university in New York, discusses the average Columbia students' I.Q. and plays “25 cr 64.”

:sd[The band forms the letters “C” and “U”. Two lines are above and below the letters. As “25 or 6 to 4” is played, the two lines form the letters “N” and “Y”. This is formed in order to spell “C.U.N.Y.”]

Another great attraction of New York City is the fine theatre there. One of the more popular present Broadway hits is “Peter Pan, Annie, The King and I Ain’t Misbehavin at the Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,” which is the story of Luke and Lana, who are fleeing from the disgrace that followed when Sister Ramona became pregnant by a visiting sailor. They all die during a cholera epidemic when they're rUn over by a truck. Sandy, their dog, takes Sister Ramona’s orphan child, Esmerelda, or Annie for short, and sets out on a 45 year quest for the Holy Grail. Watch now as the band salutes the great entertainment available in New York.

:sd[The band forms “42 st” and plays “The Stripper.”]

Yet another wonderful site in New York is Central Park. This park features a wonderful central location and has lots of grass. The band salutes this park and New York City with a visual representation of the true spirit of New York.

:sd[The band forms the letter “I”, a heart, and the letters “NY”. The heart rotates. The band plays “Peter Gunn.” During the middle of the song, the saxes pull stocking masks over their faces and begin to mug someone at the top of the heart. The band continues to march around the mugging without noticing. By the end of the song. several people have been mugged.]

Be back in two years when you'll all be another year closer to graduation.

:sd[The band marches off on yardlines to "Ever True"]
