Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you buckwheats, it’s the Brown University Custard’s Last Band.

:sd[Band runs out in Indian costumes, which is mildly humorous, but not half as ridiculous as the Bucknell Band’s blue and orange cowboy suits.]

The Brown Band would like to welcome the Bucknell Bison Band and also offer its congratulations on your recent recovery from hoof and mouth disease. The band forms a buffalo chip on the field and plays “I Want to be Around to Pick Up the Pieces.”

In addition to welcoming the Bucknell student and alumnus here today, the band also bids a very special welcome to Dr. Mr. Rogers, Professor of Pediatric Gynecology at Bucknell, who has agreed to be the band’s guest conductor this afternoon.

:sd[As the following tune is sung to the Mr. Rogers theme song, the band pulls out cardigan sweaters and sneakers from the female band member’s papooses. These are then adorned in the style of Mr. Rogers.]

> It’s a beautiful day in the stadium,\
> A beautiful day for a lady um,\
> Would you be mine? Could you be mine?\
> So let’s make the most of this beautiful day,\
> Since we’re all stuck here we’d might as well play,\
> Would you be mine? Could you be mine?\
> Won’t you be my neighbor?

Hi there Band. Would you like to be my neighbor? You’re a very special band. Can you form a square? :sd[The band forms 3 sides of a square.]

I like the way you do that. We’re going to do something very special today. We’re going to play like the Bucknell Band. Do you think you can do that? :sd[Band plays dischord.]

I knew you could. You know music is very special because it’s the universal language, sc I want you all to close your eyes and play something that reminds you of me. :sd[Band plays Mickey Mouse Theme.]

The band presents “Bucknell in the Twenty-Fifth century.” Our story so far: The year is 2435. A team of Bucknell students, after years of intensive research against almost insurmountable technical and theoretical problems, has discovered fire. As we join our heroes, we find them applying for a grant to continue their research for a way to put it out. The band bursts into flames, suggests a solution, and plays “Light My Fire.”

:sd[The band forms a flame, which grows as the song is played. The people at the top of the flame wave red, orange, and yellow towels. As the flame reaches its maximum height, the drum major pours water on the top, causing the flame to diminish.]

Be back in two weeks when we play Penn, Brown’s second non-conference game,

:sd[Band marches off on yardlines to “Ever True.”]
