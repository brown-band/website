Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you Nassau nerds, it’s the Brown University if you’ve got athletes foot, don’t blame Desenex, footballing Band.

Now that the teams are back in their cages, we’d like to tell you a few interesting facts about Ivy League football. Did you know that each player is required to be able to grunt to ten in several languages? Also, many of these Ivy players were born with silver cups in their pants. The truth is football is really nothing but a bunch of men jumping on top of each other. From this, we can see why it is so popular at Princeton. The band forms a football on the field and plays “0 and 2, No Wonder You’re Blue.”

:sd[The band forms said football and plays “Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue,” during which the football deflates.]

Turning from Saturday afternoon comatose to Saturday Night Live...

:sd[The band forms a shape resembling a Princeton student’s body. One member of the band jumps around acting like Mr. Bill.]

> -Today, Mr. Bill, we’re going on a tour of the Princeton student body.
>
> -Oh, Good. I like meeting new people.
>
> -Now we’ll just shrink you down to microscopic size and you can go inside this Princeton student’s body to try and find his brain.
>
> -Not that kind of student body. Oh Nooooooooooooooooo!
>
> -We’ll just put you in his ear. :sd[Mr. Bill runs in the ear of the body and out of the other ear.] Oh, you came out the other ear just like everything else. How about going in the nose?
>
> -Oh Noooo! I can’t. It’s too high up in the air.
>
> -Okay, we’ll put you in his mouth. :sd[Mr. Bill enters the body’s mouth and falls to the stomach area.]
>
> -Oh :break[Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo]{hyphens}!
>
> -Well, Mr. Bill, what do you see?
>
> -He has no guts.
>
> -Well, there’s no sense locking any farther in that direction.
>
> -No wait, I found his brain. He was sitting on it all the time.
>
> -Good work, Mr. Bill.

The Band salutes Mr. Bill and plays “By the Time I get to Pharynx.”

Turning from misplaced parts to mislaid forms, the Brown Band Sex Counseling Center would like to ask the freshman class a few questions, and requests them to leave their answers posted in a prominent location.

The band forms your response to the last question and plays “The Survey with the Fake on Top.”

:sd[The band plays “The Surrey with the Fringe on Top,” during which the formation changes from the male sex symbol to the female sex symbol.]

Be back in two years when we: 11 once again wish we weren’t.

:sd[Band marches off to “Ever True” on yardlines.]
