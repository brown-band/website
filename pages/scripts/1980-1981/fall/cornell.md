Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you Cornell flakes, it’s the Brown University Wedding Band.

The Brown Band and the Cornell Band would like to announce their somewhat hasty engagement and invite you to join them at their wedding this afternoon.

:sd[The following is sung to the tune of “The Brady Bunch.”]

> It’s the story of the band of Bruno,\
> Who was bringing up a half a pint of scotch\
> All of them had pants of white, just like virgins,\
> But they really weren’t.

The Band now offers a musical description of their premarital bliss.

:sd[The band forms a Tic-Tac-Toe board resembling that used by the Brady Bunch and plays “Love Story.” During the preceding lines, one person appears in each of the squares except the center one.]

:sd[The following is sung to the Brady Bunch theme.]

> It’s the story of the Cornell Band,\
> Who were busy with instruments of their own.\
> They were 127 living all together,\
> In the CORNELL ZONE.

:sd[During the preceding lines, the band has already formed a church scene, complete with a center isle and pews. The horns are playing the “Wedding March” in a minor key, as the bride and groom march down the isle. The band is kneeling in the pews and is crying. As the voice says “The Cornell Zone,” the horns switch to playing the theme from the “Twilight Zone.” The band begins to look terrified and wanders aimlessly about the field. The following is read in the voice of Rod Sterling.]

A band goes away to get married. It should be the happiest day of their life. Little did they know that they would be trapped for all eternity in the CORNELL ZONE. :sd[The band screams.] SPLAT!

The band ponders their strange fate and plays “Does Anybody Really Know What Time Zone it is?”.

Their honeymoon was spent at the College Town Motor Inn to commemorate the night they met. Soon after they arrived, they felt compelled to leave their room for a late night walk. They walked to a bridge over Niagra Gorge. There they stood, band in band, when down from the heavens, Holy Cow, the great cow of paradise :sd[Band moos] swooped down and carried them off to cow heaven.

:sd[During the preceding lines, the band had formed something resembling a gorge. When the voice said “the cow swooped down,” two members dressed like a cow, swooped down upon the couple and saved them from disaster. The band then played “Gonna Fly Now.”]

Be back for hockey season when the band stops balling and starts pucking around.

:sd[Band marches off on yardlines to "Ever True."]
