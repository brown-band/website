Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you little green peons, it’s the John Nicholas Brown University Band. Once upon a time, there was a small boy, named John Nicholas Brown, growing up in the colonies. It could be seen, even at this early stage, that the events of his childhood were leading him to fulfill his ultimate destiny, the founding of a University.

:sd[By now the band should be in 3 distinct groups. One group has formed John Nicholas Brown’s house, the second has formed a long Ratty line, and the third is acting like a drunk band.]

The severe drought of 1730, which destroyed all the family’s crops, forced them to subsist that winter on Artichoke Pasta Medley. Severe snowstorms the next winter caused a shortage of fire wood and the entire family was forced to sleep in a lounge. It was during this snowbound winter that John Brown began his writing career with the famous <u>Concentration Essays</u>.

Despite this, and long Christmas breaks spent studying, John was still a little loose on the verbal side. Upon turning 18, John Brown ventured forth into the world. As he kissed his mother goodbye, he said, “Mother, I’m going to found a University.” His mother’s reply was to be an inspiration to him always. “That‘s ‘find a University,’ John, not ‘found.’ I think you should give up on grammar and work on other areas of English. In short, go spell, John.” :sd[The band plays “Gospel John.”]

So our hero went walking through the woods, spelling quietly to himself. One day, he saw a line of people and a broken down computer. John convinced them to join him in his quest for a University. Next, he found a drunk band. This group also mindlessly followed. He led them all to a beautiful spectacular city, with fresh air and nonpay public toilets. Impressed with the glory of the city, John decided to set up his University.

But they threw him out of Warren. He wandered north, with his followers, where next to a river, brown with pollution, beneath a sky, brown with storm clouds, he discovered the final ingredient of a University. Watch now as the band recreates that magnificent find.

:sd[The band now forms a replica of the Brown seal on the field. In order to make the seal lock realistic, red, yellow, white, and brown ballons are used to liven up the formation. The band plays Brown songs as they march into this formation. The Alma Mater is then played.]

Join the band for hockey season in Meehan and the band will join you in you’an.

:sd[March off in the seal to “Ever True to Brown.”]
