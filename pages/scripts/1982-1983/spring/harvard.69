Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and both of you loyal Brunonians who voted in the USC elections last week, it's the Brown University "maybe Jacob Neusner was right after all" Band!
</sp>
<sp>
How many times will we be forced to vote for the UCS? Are we talking multiple elections here or what? 
</sp>
<sp>
The Band forms a $1500 voting machine, flips a coin on the ice and plays "Yes, We Have No Vice-President." 
</sp>
<sp>
Speaking of controversial campus issues, what do you think about intimate sex? Is Rusty Wright? Watch now as the Band salutes love, Brown style, and plays "Hot Stuff."

Be back next fall, when the Brown Band triumphs over the Penn State football team.
