Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you excited participants, it's the Brown University "Not ready for the Ice Capades" Band.

For our opening number, we introduce the hottest new act since Tai an Randy. We ask the audience to please rise and join our own Dorothy Hamlet and Too-Too in dancing to the pop favorite "Hot Stuff". C'mon folks, let's dance!!

Wasn't that great? Now look as the band forms everyones favorite ice-maker - the Zamboni, and salutes Barry Manilow by playing "Copacabana".

And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. The Grand Finale -- With a kick and a fall line, it's the Can Can.

Be back next Friday when PC and Brown meet in the battle for the prestigious "Seekonk Cup".
