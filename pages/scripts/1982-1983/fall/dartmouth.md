## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you grovelling graduates, it’s the Brown University “It must be an inside joke” Band!!

Yes, fun-seekers, it looks like we’re about to part with yet another class of your favorite rowdies: it seems that our band seniors have squandered all of their $40,000 allowances, have actually managed to pass 28 courses, and must now join the esteemed ranks of elder Brunonians in the Real World. But what are they to do with their degrees? Where will they go? After all, unemployment is rising steadily, interest rates are about to explode, and inflation is just eating up all of us. But never fear, ’83! There is <u>one</u> place left where you can still:

:::script-list

- A) receive lots and lots of food money at the New Hampshire border and still be broke by the White River Junction HoJo’s;
- B) use all the Hefty bags you want;
- C) get your own, personal, bronze statuette of Ezra Cornell, available in yellow only;
- D) eat some paste; and
- F) the Princeton Band.

:::

This fantastic place is so wonderful, there are no attendance policies, no Oktobeerfest hangovers, and no pot. Why, you can even sing dirty songs at toll booths and find the right size uniform too! Where is this magical land? And how can you reach it? Watch now as the Band forms the Sci Li, plays “It’s Better in Heaven,” and sends its graduating seniors off to that great, big band bus in the sky.

And now, please join the Band in bidding a fond farewell to…

Lisa “You see? I <u>am</u> an upperclassman. They gave me a senior line” Aliferis

Show-writing chairman Matthew “Take my joke, please” Merzbacher

Lane “Oh, it’s a new dance I just invented. I call it ‘Shake and Break’” Wallace

Drum major Luise “Yay, I finally get to hold the big stick, even if it is kind of short” Wolflein

Alisa “Will you just shut up already? We’re sick and tired of hearing you talk so much” DeBiasio

Voice of the Band Greg “But I can relate better to younger women. Really. I mean it.” James

Dirck “Just how many rude noises <u>can</u> you make with your bone?” Schilling

Sara “You mean Bill Moffit didn’t write a bagpipe part for ‘Get it on’?” Low

George “C’mon, the piccolo section doesn’t <u>really</u> look at my pants, do they?” Lobo Maloof

Business Manager Kathy “<u>No</u>, Irvin. You’re completely wrong” Rosenfie1d

Vice President Howie “That was so good, we get to do it again” Klein

President Irvin “O.K., Irv, you win. We won’t talk about your crotch at the senior show” Lustig

And, ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a great, big round of applause for the Brown Bear, Barbara “I’m not really a student. They just rent me from the ‘cute and adorable’ section of Bear Necessities” Weiss

:sd[The Band plays “Bits and Pieces” during these senior lines, and marches off on yard lines to “Ever True to Brown” and thunderous applause.]

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, whereas Dr Seuss went to Dartmouth, it’s the Brown University Iambic Pentameter Band.

That Dartmouth Band, That Dartmouth Band\
I do not like that Dartmouth Band.\
Would you like them in your sleep?\
Would you like them with a sheep?\
I would not, could not in my sleep!\
I would not, could not with a sheep!\
Do you like them in Big Green?\
I do not - they are all obscene.\
They must change their mascot now.\
Big Green must go, must go and now!\
We have our own suggestions eight\
We ask you now to contemplate -

:::script-list

- A. Fighting 'Slime-molds (Icky poo)
- B. Charging Mucus (Awful goo)
- C. Algae Tide
- D. Ratty Food
- E. Frog in Blender (Oh how rude)
- E and a half. Big Green Eggs and Ham
- And F. of course, The Princeton Band!

As he slides in La Machine,\
Kermit becomes both Red and Green.

On a serious note, we salute the final two months of the campaign for Brown by playing a series of Brown songs and forming the emblem of the Campaign - University Hall inside an Oval.

Be back in one week as Brown Hockey proves that the cadets of Army can’t shoot straight.
