Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Penn tup Frustrations, it’s the Brown University “Why are all famous men named after holidays” Band!!

And now, a Quadracentennialnonodecimal minute. Here is Mrs. Christopher Columbus:

> 490 years ago, Chris left home and set out to find India. He was an adventurous man and he was strong in his convictions. Lord knows he spent enough time talking to all those smelly old sailors. The truth is he never came home at night. He was out in those filthy bars carousing with his three lady friends: Nina, Pinta, and some broad named Santa Maria. If you want to know the real truth, I divorced him and he didn’t want to pay alimony. So he up and sailed away with his three women…

Uh, er, yes… thank you Mrs. Columbus. Ladies and gentlemen, you have been listening to Christopher Columbus’ wife, Ohio, on this Quadracentennialnonodecimal minute. The band challenges Christopher Columbus’ theories, forms its own model of the earth and plays: “Sailing on top of the world”

:sd[band forms a straight line and ship sails across and falls off at the end. Band plays: Sitting On Top of the World.]

Turning from Columbus to Balboa, the band salutes Philadelphia’s only hero as we present: Rocky the 13th, part III in 3-D!

:sd[band plays Gonna Fly Now and forms a bent arm on the field. Muscle flexes.]

In this episode, Rocky faces his most deadly, frightening, and horrifying opponent -- the Penn Band, who has made the fatal mistake of interrupting Rocky during one of his training breakfasts. Rocky retaliates by throwing his morning protein in the face of his opponent as the band plays “Yolk Gets In Your Eyes”.

:sd[Band forms a whole egg and plays “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes”.]

Be back in two weeks for parents weekend when Rocky faces the wrath of mom.
