Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, William and Mary and Ted and Alice, it’s the Brown University planned obsolescence Band.

Since this is our first, and last, visit to Williamsburp, oh excuse me, watch how much we can cram into 7, no 3, no wait 5 minutes of halftime, er pregame show. We have a few questions about Southern cooking. Do you put one or two lumps of suger in your grits? Where can one find fresh lobster here? Can we really order Hog Jowl Mcmuffins at the local McDonalds? On second thought, maybe you’d better just point us to Busch Gardens for the free beer. Watch now as the band forms its alimentary tract, gets indigestion, and plays "Roll out the Barrel".

And now, the band takes a look at hysterical Williamsburg. First, there were the Indians who put strange things in their peace pipes.\
Then, the French tourist trappers moved in. They sold the pelts of unfortunate tourists and destroyed the Indian tourist industry. So the Indians moved to Cleveland. Next, the Revolution came, and with it came Minutemen, who have since had a sex change operation and now sell Orange Juice. Nowadays, the Indians have returned and may be found outside the stadium scalping tickets.

The Band forms a musket shooting off, salutes George Washington and his Minutemaids in case you didn’t get it the first time, and plays Georgie’s Girls.

Here’s today’s fact of the day du jour: William (of William and Mary fame) was really Wilhelm of Orange. Be back in Providence in ten years when the band asks the musical question: Are your school colors green and yellow because Wilhelm was Flemish?
