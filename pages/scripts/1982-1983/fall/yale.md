Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you future supporters of the band, it’s the Brown University, "Don’t we need new uniforms?" Band.

:sd[Band runs onto field and forms a question mark "?"]

We have noticed several very mysterious changes which have occurred during the summer. Do we have all the facts? Is there an explanation? Watch now, as the band goes, "In Search Of…"

:::script-list

- A. The Dean of Residential Life.
- B. West Quad.
- C. Manning Street.
- D. The houses across the street from the Grad Center.
- and F. The Princeton Band.

The Band ponders these and other questions, salutes our visitors from New Haven, and plays "Swinging Safari".

We would also like to note the new freshman unit which has been added in South Wayland and remind you that there is absolutely no truth to the rumor that this unit is numbered delta two.

What has caused this rash of changes at an otherwise peaceful university? Has Mr. "Your name here" paid ten million dollars to name the Geo-Chem center? Is somebody actually listening to Jacob Neusner? Or is it strange beings from outer space?

:sd[Band forms E.T.]

No, not ET. These beings are far stranger. They make awful sounding noises and seem to on1y be able to understand the most primitive signals. Yes, it’s the dread Yalians!

:sd[E.T. becomes M.T.]

Turning from ET to MT, the cranial content of a typical Yalie, and turning from MT to MTV, the summer’s cable television craze, the band is proud to present our newest and most realistic video tape ever.

:sd[M.T. becomes M.T.V.]

Watch now as we show our own rendering of "Does anybody really know what time it is?"

:sd[Band Plays "Does Anybody Really Know What Time it is?" and forms a digital clock with the numbers 9:69.]

Be back next week when we’ll take off our sweaters and more!
