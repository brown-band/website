Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you unkissed oranges, it’s the Brown University Band News Bears.

And now, the Saturday Afternoon Report. At the top of the news, the continuing Wall Street Rush. The band recognizes the roll of Princeton Graduates during the latest Dow-Jones rally. After all, somebody has to clean up after the bulls. The band forms an overheated ticker-tape machine on the field, and plays “Up Up and Away”.

In other news, the Educational Testing Service announced that, for the first time in nineteen years, average SAT scores have risen. This means that the current crop of college students are really the bottom of the heap. In the same statistical study, ETS also disclosed a correlation between playing a musical instrument and rude disgusting behavior. Princeton Admissions said that they anticipated no problem since they had not accepted anybody who could play an instrument.

By the way, did you hear the one about the message that the mother gave to her son at school when his SAT scores arrived in the mail? ETS phone home. In response to that last joke, the band forms yesterday’s lunch and plays “Up Up and Away”. No wait, we already played that. Instead, we swear off eating flowers and play “Everything’s Coming Up Roses” .

Speaking of indigestion, the band salutes the Princeton Eating clubs and asks, “What does a tiger eat for lunch?”
