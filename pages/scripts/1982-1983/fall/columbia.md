Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and dearly beloved, it’s the Brown University Night of the Living Band

:sd[Band stumbles on to field as zombies into a coffin]

We are gathered here today to salute things which have recently passed away.

:sd[Band falls down on field]

Just Kidding. Today we add to the list a dear friend - Baker Field. Paying tribute to this famous coliseum, where many hard fought battles were fought hard, the Band forms a coffin and plays “Chopin’s Funeral March”.

:sd[Form a coffin and play Funeral March]

Incidentally, Chopin is dead too. So this is Baker Field. Well we see the demolition is already well under way. Now that you have all this open space, we have a few suggestions for what to do with it - You could:

:::script-list

- A. Shovel it
- B. Replace the Turf with real Columbian grass
- C. Improve the Neighborhood by starting a slum
- D. Have a really great bonfire
- or E. Build a new football stadium
- and F. The Princeton Band.

We wish the Columbia Football team good luck at their new home in the Meadowlands but ask how the Columbia band plans to get there. The Band forms a subway train on the field and plays “Give My regards to the Meadowlands”.

:sd[Form it and play it - at end of song Flag is thrown]

Alright Band, that’s it! You’ve been penalized five yards for obscene formation.

:sd[Formation shrinks five yards]

This is our last show of the year and we’re going to tell all the stupid jokes that weren’t intelligent enough for any other school.

What do you get when you mix Milk of Magnesia and Vodka?\
A Phillips Screwdriver.\
What do you call a short guy who rides around on the Paris Subway?\
A Metro-gnome.\
Why did the Harvard student cross the road?\
He was attached to the Yalie.\
Why did the Columbia student cross the road?\
It was stapled to the chicken.

In memory of these dead jokes, the band forms a chicken on the field, salutes the Ivy League and plays “The Magnificent Seven” and Columbia.

What is it band? Oh - it’s down the hall, second door on the left.
