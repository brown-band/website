Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Dairy Heirs, it’s the Brown University Holier than Cow Band.

:sd[Band runs onto field into a spaceship]

And now, another episode of "Cows in Space". This is the four year mission of the starship Ezraprise. To explore Strange new worlds. To seek out social life at Cornell. To boldly go where no real man has gone before. As we join the crew of the Ezraprise, they are curdling pasturize fodder and fodder into udder space. On the bridge, ready to jump at any emergency, is Captain Cow Sagan, the big cheese. He’s taking measurements on the rate of expansion of the cowsmoos to test his "Big Bang Theory of the procreation of the Universe" .

The band salutes that Cornell Professor whom we have all groaned to love, forms a spaceship on the field, and plays "Billions and Billionsboard March".

As they fly through the twilight zone towards the constellation of Elsie Major … We interrupt this show for a non - sequitor. The band asks some random Cornell students "How do you spell relief" and salutes the drug most commonly prescribed by the Cornell emergency hotline, while playing "Plop Plop Fizz Fizz"

Moo-ving right along, the band turns to the Cornell football team - all members of the Cow Tau fraternity - who are currently enrolled in a program in Cornell’s new School of Agricultural Hotel Management. That’s where the waiters serve moo-goo-gai pan, Moosehead beer, Chocolate Mousse, Mooscatel, Moonster Cheese, and Milk. All for $1.99 plus cow tipping. The band notes Cornell’s Students amoorous preferences, and plays "Midnight in Ma’s-cow" by Mooreese Chevache.

Be back in two years or 24 moonths when the band plays “Begin the Bovine".
