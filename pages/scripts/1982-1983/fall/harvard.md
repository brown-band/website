Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you Commoners, presenting 150 of the 11,000,000 unemployed Americans, it’s the Brown University “It’s all Reagan’s fault” Band.

With student funds drastically decimated, the only way a Brown student can afford a good room on campus is to work for a travel agency. But the Harvard student need only root about the square, where he can:

:::script-list

- A. Toss David’s Cookies
- B. A Pepper and work at substandard enterprises like McSteves and McBarnes and Noble.
- C. Clerk at the Harvard Sty, accoutrements for the corporate pig.
- D. Serve Extra-Strength Ice Cream at Emack and Polio’s.
- or F. The Princeton Band.

Cutting corners, the band enters the new Harvard Triangle on the world’s only open-air subway, and plays “Take the T Train”.

The newly renovated square will make the perfect place to watch the Battle of the Ivy League Stars. Tied with Yale and having twelve stars is the team from Harvard consisting of the Law School faculty which is known as la creme de la creme because they’re homogenized, and all white. Cornell’s team, with billions and billions of stars, will be represented by Carl Sagan and will be hosting the cliff diving competition. The highlight of this year’s competition will be the battle of the inanimate objects, pitting the Princeton Cannon against the Radcliffe Junior class. Second prize in the competition is Bo Derek, who, as we all know, is Derek Bok spelled sideways. The first place school will get Brooke Shields come next fall, if mom says OK. And the winner, of course, is the always stellar Brown Band which, according to the New York Times, receives 14 stars. The Band forms one of these stars on the field and salutes the only Star it knows whose meat is guaranteed fresh by playing “Star Market Wars”.

Speaking about the Ivy League reminds us that tomorrow is Hallowe’en. That’s when Harvard is disguised as a University, Harvard band members are disguised as musicians, Ed King is disguised as a Democrat, Peg Heckler ... , and Harvard Business school students are disguised as humanitarians. Harvard has its own brand of trick or treating. What’s the treat - a Harvard diploma and a good job. What’s the trick - you have to go to Harvard. Watch as the band forms a flaming Jack-o-Lantern on the field and plays “Pumpkin at the Woodside”.

Be back in two years when the band makes its bi-annual trek to the Head of the Charles - just like Lady Di.
