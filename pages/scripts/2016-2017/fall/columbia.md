## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is probably better at football than the Columbia football team, it’s the Brown University “Put us in, coach!” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

This past spring, Columbia students erupted with anger and began protesting a new Henry Moore statue on campus. Despite how well its twin already fits in on Brown’s campus, the same statue evoked outrage at Columbia and led to petitions calling for its removal. Here are our suggestions for a new statue in front of Butler Library that might be less controversial:

:::script-list

- A. All of the Columbia football players to have ever won a game
- B. Of Limitations
- C. Pygmalion’s favorite
- D. A giant bear with a lamp going through its head
- E. Of Liberty, and
- F. The Princeton Band

:::

We know you have the cream of the crop of statues from which to choose! Watch now as the Band ghost“busts” a move.

We recently learned that Columbia University suspended its football program in 1906 due to a rise in serious injuries and deaths from collegiate football. Deeming the sport “too violent,” Columbia’s President Nicolas Butler rightly decided that the least violent time to resume the sport would be... 1915. Of course, the most peaceful time in world history! President Butler also called football an “academic nuisance,” which would explain why Columbia never really re-formed its football team - just ask their opponents between 1983 and 1988! Watch now as the Band B-lieves in you and plays “Be Bruno and Be Brown.”

Join us at halftime as the band’s fightin’ seniors take on Graduation - wait until you see what’s under our caps and gowns... wink.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s losing a lot of seniors, it’s the Brown University “But we’ll gain a lot of freshmen” BAANNNNNNDD!!!!!!!!!!

It’s Saturday. Aka November 19. Aka International Men’s Day. Aka Adam Driver’s birthday. Aka World Toilet Day. Aka National Bagpipe Day. Aka aka aka. Aka game day! Aka Football vs. Columbia. Aka the last home game of the year. Aka the senior game! Aka the day when we’re not crying, you’re crying! Watch now as the band celebrates National Carbonated Beverage with Caffeine Day and honors its seniors with a carbonated, but un-caffeinated beverage.

_A trumpet, had Gabe always blown\
But he chose to slide into trombone\
With a German hallo\
And his fancy cello\
No matter which section, Gabe shone_

_Our Chris is the master of Geo\
He \*rocks\* from Boston to Rio\
With a sax in his hand\
He returned to the band\
Great praises to his beard do we-owe_

_Sarah, our bandie who sings\
Engineering is really her thing\
Clarinet and band history\
Her religion, a mystery\
Her absence will really quite sting_

_Charlie Gleason, the band’s boy wonder\
Though often, we bandies do blunder\
No, his name isn’t Kyle\
‘Cause he has \*saxy\* style\
Pirate scrabble will show his true thunder._

_As prez, Caleb “salient” Hersh reigns\
No one’s great as Gaston, so he claims\
With a road beer to bring\
The only true thing\
the proletarians have to lose are their chains_

_To P. Kirschner, a great section leader\
Without fail, he keeps the Band’s meter\
Leads the bus in our song,\
His shorts, never long,\
How will we survive without Peter?_

_Isabella is a fun-loving chick\
Who’s always rocking out on her picc\
She’s Dusky’s best pal,\
And our favorite AL,\
A band without her makes us sick_

_Our beloved conductor Dan Muller\
And trust us, we won’t watch another\
At the end of his reign,\
All aboard the sad twain :sd[Band/Train whistle: choo choo]\
Without him our lives will be duller_

_Ol’ Kyle always had us awestruck,\
Without him, the band runs amok\
He’s our diamond boy\
He conducts us with joy\
Next year we’ll miss him like... crazy_

_Lainie’s script reading, who would’ve guessed! \*(slowly)\* On Halloween, decked out in her best,\
Was in Europe last fall,\
In her absence, we bawl,\
With her humor, we’ve always been blessed._

_Much love to our Grandma H. Siegel\
She’s the precious ring to our Smeagol\
She makes us all grin\
But please, DON’T COME IN\
This Nutmegger can’t leave, it’s illegal!_

That’s all, folks! To our seniors: With much love, get a job. Everyone else: thanks for bearing with us all season, and join us November 30 as we cheer on Brown Men’s Basketball, and later this winter when we turn into the world’s best (and only) skating band! Brown Band out!
