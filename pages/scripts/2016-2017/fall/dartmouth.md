## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is here to reconnect you to civilization, it's the Brown University "myspace isn't a thing anymore" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We think it's great that you've isolated yourselves from civilization in order to do some much needed reflection in the solitude of New Hampshire. The lack of electricity, the endless forests, and the five year delay in news between Hanover and the rest of the world must really help you find inner peace. Just in case you were wondering, twenty-two candidates have entered the race for president! We'll tell you who won when we come back in two years. Alternatively, you can wait for the pack mule with news from the outside world to arrive. Watch now as the Band imagines it's at Dartmouth and does a time warp back through the past few years.

We're sorry to interrupt your croquet matches and themed frat parties for this pregame show. Back in Providence we have frat-themed parties to unpack the social constructs that undergird their conceptual existence. But we digress. Back to asking the important questions. Why is your color green? Doesn't that clash with your salmon shorts? Does Keggy wear Vineyard Vines? Did your collar come popped that way, or was that a pre-orientation event? Watch now as the Band seeks answers to these all-important questions and Brings the Fraternity.

OUTRO!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is ready to introduce ourselves, it's the Brown University "here it comes!" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

My dearest, Keggy,\
From the first moment we laid eyes on your gleaming silver face, we knew it was meant to be. You're everything we've ever wanted: rock solid abs and a steady supply of beer just for me. Hopefully we're the most appealing thing you saw in the tall grass. \
We do think we have really nice sass. \
Do you believe in love at first sight or should we walk by again? \
Run away with us, Keggy. Run away with us to heaven! \
Watch now as the Band forms our love, \
And drinks tequila, an answered prayer from above.

We were feeling kind of sheep-ish about coming to Dart-moth this year, but we finally buck-ed up, gathered all the otter members of the band, and boar-ded the bus to Hanover. Un-pork-tunately, the bus trip was un-pheasant because a shrew of the roudier members were horse-ing around the mole time, it was toad-al panda-monium. You may mink it was a-moose-ing, but ewe have no i-deer what it was pike lion around trying to sleep with all the noise. Next time alpaca pair of ear-slugs. Well, now that we have your attention, watch.

Because we all expected to be drunk all day, we've done some research in advance to figure out where Dartmouth students go on campus. So here are the places you'll go if you're a Dartmouth student:

:::script-list

- A. Up the street, for alcohol
- B. Down the street, for alcohol
- C. To the frats, for alcohol
- D. To the forest, for alcohol
- E. To the fields, for sheep, and
- F. The Princeton Band

We can't wait to join you up or down the street tonight. Feel free to go to the fields without us though. Watch now as the band prepares for tonight and plays Brown Drinking Song.

Thanks frozen wasteland, you've been a wonderful crowd. Join us next week in Providence as we don't die of hypothermia and exposure while we hand out AARP cards to our seniors. Brown Band out.
