Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves a good challenge, it's the Brown University "now defend these candidates!" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Well, looks like we've got an election this year between Thing One and Thing Two. Or, as we like to call them, Red Fish and Blue Fish. We do actually think that this election is right out of Doctor Seuss - one candidate is the Lorax, warning us about the impending apocalypse, and the other, and again we're not naming names, is doing his best to mimic Yertle the Turtle. In the end, both characters disappear from prominence, so what does that say about this election? Watch now as the band turns your frown about this election upside down and plays Imperial March.

We're off to great places, today is the day! Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvan-i-a! On the road travelling, there may be an unpleasant bump, and the chances are then, that we'll be stuck with a Trump.

So be sure when you step, step with care and great tact, and remember to uphold the Affordable Care Act! Oh, the places you'll canvas, to get out the vote, but take care what you say, to avoid a bad quote. As democracy prevails, with few casualties at most, watch now as the band political parties hard, and forms the west coast.

I cannot vote in this scam, I cannot vote for them, Uncle Sam. I cannot do it on a ballot, I cannot do it with a mallet. I cannot vote in a voting booth, I cannot vote for anything but the truth. I cannot vote with a pen, I cannot vote in Cheyenne. I cannot vote with my hands, I cannot vote representing any bands. I cannot wait for November nine, hopefully by then all will be fine. Watch now as the band forms a smile, and plays In the Fire and Flames while in denial.

That's all for now! We're off to convince one particular candidate that a person's a person, no matter how small... his hands are. Brown band out!
