## Halftime

::script-note[This is the script we wrote for the Fall 2016 URI game, but the URI athletics department did not allow us to read it during halftime.]

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that will try to be on its best behavior for the high schoolers, it’s the Brown University "let’s be honest, that’s a low standard" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We’ve heard that URI published a bucket list of things to do on campus, so we’d like to share our own list of things we want to do on your campus:

:::script-list

- A. Netflix and chill on the quad
- B. Cross out "beautiful" on the brick
- C. Drunkenly tackle Rhody at a game
- D. Get naked for no reason whatsoever
- E. Pee in your botanical gardens, and
- F. The Princeton Band

:::

Actually, come to think of it, we already did all those things right before the game. Watch now as the band looks for something better to do and plays "Party at U.R.I."

Speaking of fun things to do at URI, we’ve heard that you are really into Pokemon Go. However, it’s started to become a safety risk, as students won’t stop looking down at their phones, even while crossing streets! But hey, none of that matters if you caught that Zubat. This leads us to ask: what would you have done for a Scyther? Watch now as the band learns how to safely catch a Pokemon and plays "I Want Zubat."

Dear Veronica Smart - while walking toward the dining hall, we told our significant other that we wanted to try "Butt stuff." Upon hearing this, they made a beeline straight for the Butt and wouldn’t leave. It’s a problem, because it closed shortly afterward and they’ve been stuck in there for hours! How do I get my significant other out of the Butt? Help! We’re still waiting for our response, but in the meantime, watch as the Band forms this situation and plays "In the Butt."

Well, it seems as though we’ve extricated ourselves from the Butt and are now halfway back to Providence! Join us next week as we score a hat trick at home against Stetson. Brown Band out!
