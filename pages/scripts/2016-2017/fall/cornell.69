Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that can't wait to spend the whole weekend with our families, it's the Brown University "money please!" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We are so glad to finally have our families around. Now the laundry that has been piling up for months can get washed, and we can blame the lack of work we'll be doing this weekend on something other than procrastination. We would take our families down to WaterFire tonight, but unfortunately, the one night it makes sense for WaterFire to happen, the organizers decided that it was a waste of time. Watch now as the band tries to recreate WaterFire for our families and plays We Didn't Start WaterFire.

For some reason, ever since our parents got here, we've spent all of our time cleaning our room, taking out the trash, and washing our dishes. This isn't who we used to be, back when we were carefree college students who wore sweatpants everywhere and didn't shower for weeks at a time. That was yesterday. Watch now as the band rebels academically and plays Brown Man Bored.

Looks like our parents have something important to tell us, and it doesn't look good. See you on the other side.<sbr/>

We've heard recently that being a farmer can help you get into Cornell. Here are a few other things that we suggest highlighting on your application to Cornell:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Running your own Days Inn while juggling high school classes and extracurriculars</sli>
<sli>B. Hiding corpses in flowers</sli>
<sli>C. Knowing how to efficiently collect semen from horses</sli>
<sli>D. Being Ann Coulter</sli>
<sli>E. A small donation of 1 million dollars and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Well, all of you high schoolers in the audience better get started. Watch now as the band believes in you and plays I'm a Believer.

The Cornell Daily Sun announced last spring that they would no longer be a "daily" newspaper, as they would decrease publication from five days a week to three days a week, while keeping the same name. To us, this just seems to be oxymoronic - it's an open secret that this is not "daily," so is it just the same difference to them? We're clearly confused by this seriously funny oxymoron, and suggest that this naming near miss be resolved with an awfully good solution instead of the deafening silence already being freely employed by the Cornell newspaper. Watch now as the band laughs at Cornell's newspaper and plays Brown Jeering Song.

That's all for now. Join us next week when we head to Penn state for Halloween, the scariest day of the year other than election day. Brown band out!
