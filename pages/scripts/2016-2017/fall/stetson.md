## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants to take the red pill, it’s the Brown University “is it just us, or does this raven look like a desk to you?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Thank you for joining us all down here in the rabbit hole! We’ve shrunk down to a size that makes us look like ants, swum through our own tears, and smoked hookah with a caterpillar only to find ourselves sitting at tea with you, the mad hatters. That being said, this could all be a drugged up dream, considering our past activities with the pre-cocooned being. Watch now as the Band forms this extraordinary date we had with our larval stage friend and plays “Doctor Caterpillar.”

We’d also like to take this opportunity to welcome Stetson to the great state of Rhode Island. Congratulations, you finally made it out of Florida, and into the real Ocean State! We know things are a little different around these parts - for example, not everyone here is geriatric, we don’t know what an early-bird special is, seasons are a thing, we don’t keep alligators for pets, and our governor doesn’t look like Voldemort. Lastly, when you play us, your Victory Bell won’t ring. Watch now as the Band forms our own victory bells and rings in the victory.

Keep watching for the ultimate battle of the states, Rhode Island versus Florida. Normally we’d have to pay for this kind of entertainment! See you at halftime!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that knows about real humidity, it’s the Brown University “our ideal temperature is sexy” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We would like to take this opportunity to stand in solidarity with Stetson about one of the most important issues facing modern college students: avoiding having to be outside for commencement. We know all too well what it is like to have to spend any time whatsoever outside, and we can’t even imagine what it would be like to simultaneously be in Florida. We would have all travelled to your campus to join in your protest, but that would have required going outside, which seems to conflict with the very essence of the movement. Watch now as the band joins the protesting Stetson students in spirit only, and plays “Midday Special.”

We hear you wild folks down in Florida have put up to some crazy shenanigans lately. Here are some of our favorite antics that we’ve heard about way up here in the North:

:::script-list

- A. Florida Man Puts Dragon Lizard in his Mouth, Smacks People With It
- B. Florida Man Steals Van so He Can Drive to Waffle House
- C. Florida Man tattoos black widow spider on his face to combat arachnophobia
- D. Florida Man Swears He Doesn’t Regret Tattoo of Now Old Instagram Logo
- E. Florida Man launches chair at mailman because he had no mail for him, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Thank heavens that we’re not in “The Sunshine State.” Watch now as the band drinks to forget Florida and plays “Down Your Glass.”

Recently, Stetson made national news for having a 14-year old and a 55-year old enrolled at their school. We can’t even imagine all the shenanigans they’ll get up to together - just imagine their first college party! While the 55-year old will graduate with a degree, the 14-year old will graduate at prime Florida retirement age! Watch now as the band forms their average grade and plays Brown B-evermore.

We hope you’ve enjoyed our hat trick. Join us next week as we take on the fighting Princetons at Tiger. There might be a special surprise in store... Brown band out!
