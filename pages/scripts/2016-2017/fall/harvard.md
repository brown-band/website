## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is back and better than ever, it’s the Brown University “definitely not here just to procrastinate” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

What an incredible way to \*kickoff\* the school year! We’re so excited to welcome all of the new first years to Brown and welcome back all of our alumni who like to pretend they never graduated. No matter how many people graduate, the Brown Band will always be here! We’ve survived cold winters, hot summers, broken buses, and extreme censorship just to bring you this first field show of the year. You can thank us later, since we’ll be here all semester. Except if the football team is away. Then we’ll be there all semester. Watch now as the Band figures out whether this is a home or away game and plays “We Get Around.”

Now that we’re back surrounded by our amazing friends in Providence, we’re looking forward to a new and improved football team! Unfortunately, our newest football recruit, Untitled (Lamp/Bear), couldn’t make it to the game today. Imagine all of the possibilities with him on our defensive line! Tragically, “Big Blue” was sidelined with a concussion after taking a lamp to the head. It’s a shame, he was known for his nerves of steel. Get well soon buddy! Watch now as the Band honors our favorite 20-ton, 10 million dollar fallen hero Blueno and plays “Blue Bear.”

That’s all for now! See you at halftime! Smell ya later, alligators.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s too cool for Malia, it’s the Brown University “thanks, Obama” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We’ve heard that Harvard has accepted some pretty famous students this year. Malia Obama, after feeling intimidated by the academic rigor of Brown, chose Harvard and never looked back. Maria Sharapova, who also just started at Harvard Business School, probably would have come to Brown Business School, except for the fact that we don’t have one. After all, the drug culture here would have suited her well. Oh well, at least our school doesn’t have any virgins with iPhones. Look to your left, then look to your right. Statistically, at least 1 of you has an Android. For those of you with Androids, watch now as the Band forms the iPhone’s new Airpods and plays “I Touch Myself.”

Recently, a New York firm with plans to redevelop Harvard Square announced that the Curious George store would be permanently shut down in favor of a staircase and elevator. Not only does this put the man in the yellow hat and his adorable monkey out onto the streets, but it also destroys the last shred of intellectual curiosity in Cambridge. Watch now as the Band forms the man’s yellow hat and plays Every time we think.

The loss of the only Curious George store in the world reminds us of our most painful goodbyes. Here are some other things being taken away from our youth:

:::script-list

- A. All the stuffed animals our parents sold as soon as we moved out
- B. The money we used to buy back our stuffed animals
- C. An understanding of what those millennials are doing these days
- D. Our innocence,
- E. Hope, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the Band forms our earliest memory and recreates when a Brown Man was Born.

That’s all from us this week! Join us down the road next week at URI as we literally play inside of a governor’s cup. Brown Band out!
