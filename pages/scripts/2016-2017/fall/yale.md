## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is a pro at this whole Internet thing, it's the Brown University "never Google New Haven" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We hadn't heard of Yale University before today, so we decided to Google the school. Here are some of our favorite reviews:

:::script-list

- A. lol it was lit we got them noodles
- B.This is a school for dum-dums. Hehe
- C. This college is one of the worst. When I went to this school I got kicked out cause I said I liked trains randomly
- D. It was very blurry,
- E. I ordered one via phone and was assured that returns are "no problem," and
- F. The Princeton Band

:::

Well at least now we know! Watch now as the Band chugs along and discovers that it likes trains randomly.

Recently, after the Connecticut state legislature considered taxing Yale's endowment, Rick Scott invited Yale to move to Florida instead. We're sad to report that Yale's leadership has been opposed to the idea, although we can't really blame them. We know New Haven is bad, but the only thing objectively worse is the entire state of Florida. Thus, New Haven retains its one bright spot, and we are doomed to continue our biannual trips to Yale. Watch now as the Band battles New Haven as it gets into the fray.

We can't handle this anymore, even having our mind in New Haven is awful, Bye!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is dreading Tuesday, it's the Brown University "our own elections will be better" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Should Hillary win the election Tuesday, she'll return the White House into the hands of Yale alumni - thank heavens! After eight years of the evil Crimson empire reigning over Pennsylvania Avenue, America is ready for more Yale Blue in the Oval Office, which it had previously been since 1988! Something other than our democracy is at stake this election cycle - it is possible, however unlikely, that the evil University of Pennsylvania takes back Washington D.C. for the first time since 1841. We must not allow this to happen! Watch now as the band protects the oval office from the sole man running.

:sd[Band forms a wall of protection and plays Soul Man.]

Speaking of the election, we've heard that Yale's student political organizations have been quite active recently. After endorsing the Trump, the Yale College Republicans has imploded and split into separate factions, the Yale New Republicans and the Yale College Republicans. We guess that they are just imitating their chosen party's leadership. Watch now as the band laughs from a distance at the Republicans' smooth split.

:sd[Band forms the Yale Republicans' Split and plays Smooth.]

With this as the last game before the election, and therefore the end of the world, we would like to take this opportunity to say goodbye. It has been a pleasure playing for you all, and we hope to see you all when we go to a better place: Canada. At least there we can live under the guidance of wonderboy Justin Trudeau. Watch now as the band forms our last form and plays our last song.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Brown Forevermore.]

If we survive the week, we'll see you all in Hanover as we drink away all our problems. Brown Band out.
