## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization with a message that's been two years in the making, it's the Brown University "Dana says hi back" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

It's good to be back on our favorite Halloween-themed campus. We're glad that we're always here in October, because any other time of year it would be kind of weird. Here are some of the highlights from our past trips:

:::script-list

- A. Waking up hung over in Wawa
- B. Bridging the differences between our states by visiting Drumthwacket
- C. Riding the Dinky all night long
- D. Getting stuck for 5 months in Connecticut
- E. Leaving New Jersey, and
- F. The Princeton Band

:::

Hopefully this one will be just as good. Watch now as the band gets in the Halloween spirit and plays Candy Karn Evil.

While we're here, we'd like to celebrate that Professors from Brown and Princeton split a half of the nobel prize in Physics. Apparently Nobel prizes don't need to be split evenly though, because the last recipient got the remaining half to himself. This success has inspired a new goal of ours: to get 69% of a Nobel prize for 100 new uses for our favorite mineral Cummingtonite \[(Mg,Fe<sup>2+</sup>)<sub>2</sub>(Mg,Fe<sup>2+</sup>)<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>]. Watch now as the band forms our portion of the prize and plays In Bruno and In Brown.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays For Bruno and For Brown.]

Well, we've got research to do. Nobel Peace prize out.

## Halftime

:sd[Princeton and Brown Bands perform a joint halftime show. The two script readers are distinguished by their school name as well as bold font for the Brown Script Reader.]

Princeton: Taking advantage of the opportunity to hash it out with our Brownies...it's the Princeton University Band.

**Brown: Oh. You're here. Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that thought the Princeton band was on vacation with a younger and "better" band, it's the Brown University "still bitter" Band!**

:sd[Princeton Band and Brown Band charge each other. Frolicking ensues.]

Princeton: Believe me, I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to be.

**Brown: God knows why you even bothered to show up. You never even loved me or Johnny, did you?**

Princeton: Well you're one to point the finger. You certainly spend your fair share of time off in God knows where with God knows whom doing God knows what.

**Brown: See this is the issue. You're always pushing the blame off to whoever you can.**

Princeton: But you never gave in, never acknowledged my needs and my desires. It was always about you having it any way you want it.

:sd[Bands form finger pointing at brown and play "Anyway You Want It."]

**Brown: Well, it's not like you've been such a piece of cake yourself. Don't think I don't know you've been hanging out and playing in your fountain with those other bands! And everyone's been talking about what happened in Hanover! You may not remember, but we made promises and those promises mean something. I guess for you, they did mean something, but then you went and broke our heart. My mother always warned me that a Tiger would cheat, but I wanted to believe she was wrong. And even before that, it was like you weren't even here anymore. I got a brand new blazer and you didn't even notice! You were someone I trusted, but then you became a stranger. Now you're just an unrecognizable brown-eyed tiger to me.**

:sd[Bands form angry face where Brown is the features while Brown plays "Brown-Eyed Girl"]

Princeton: This long distance is just really impossible. I barely even remember what your voice sounds like since all you ever do is write me letters instead of picking up the phone. This is no way to live out a marriage. I mean look at us. We see each other what? Twice? Maybe 3 times a year? We're hardly even corpses of the people we used to be. You don't even make an effort to come over anymore. And when you do, you're always the same beige drabby dull person. Where is the vivacious vibrance you used to be consumed with? Everything to do with you begins and ends with the same sour note. This is not living, and definitely not loving. How did our relationship devolve to such an awfully bad romance?

:sd[Bands form 2 sides of a heart which then breaks while Princeton plays "Bad Romance"]

**Brown: I guess we both have our problems. Where did we even go wrong?**

Princeton: Long distance relationships are always hard...

**Brown: Well yeah, but...**

Princeton: and when you're not here, all I have is the Cannon! You know that's not as good as Bruno's, uhhhhhh.... cannon!

**Brown: I know, but what else were we supposed to do? We both had work, and then with our child Johnny always away from us, we lost what brought us together.**

Princeton: Johnny is a good part of our lives, and seeing him so little has made us both forget how we once were. Oh Bruno, whatever happened to those days we spent together at Lawnparties here and the naked parties at Brown? 'Twas such a romance that blossomed!

**Brown: I wish we could go back to when we first met, those days we first fell in love.**

Princeton: Everything was so much simpler back then, when all we had to go on was first impressions.

:sd[Bands form band-aid and play "Impression"]

**Brown: You always made me feel so safe in your arms, you tiger.**

Princeton: I love it when you call me tiger. Especially when you throw in a little growl.

**Brown: I just can't really bear being without you anymore. You always know just what to say.**

Princeton: You've always been the best band I could ask for. I know this might seem crazy, but what do you say we move back in together?

**Brown: Nothing would make me happier than to be one again. To hold you close and cuddle on cold nights, to feel your love and warm embrace.**

Princeton: You complete me. You will always be the Winnie the Pooh to my Tigger.

**Brown: Let's just warp time and try to comprise our future out of all the best times from our past.**

:sd[Bands form two sides of a heart which come together and play "Time warp"]

Princeton: How about we go find a nice fountain to mess around in? No love lost? No hard feelings?

**Brown: I would like nothing more.**\

Princeton, Brown: R**u**n **a**w**a**y b**a**nds. R**u**n **a**w**a**y **i**nt**o** th**e** s**u**ns**e**t t**o**g**e**th**e**r.

:sd[Aside: We see here that the author has chosen to make Princeton represent the consonants and Brown represent the vowels. This is a metaphor meaning that neither one can exist without the other.]

:sd[Aside aside: Is 'y' a vowel or a consonant???]
