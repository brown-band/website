Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that pulled out our camo khakis, it's the Brown University "you can't even see us right now" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We gather here today to mourn the loss of our beloved Wilson Hall. You may have an F rating in accessibility, but you were always a solid B- building in our hearts. "FRIEEEEDMAAAAN!" just doesn't have quite the same ring as "WILSOOOOOOON!" <sd>in the style of Castaway</sd>.
</sp>
<sp>
To pay tribute to good ol' Willy, here's a list of our favorite things about Wilson Hall:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. That beer stain in Wilson 102 that we definitely don't know anything about </sli>
<sli>B. The pile of desks in the corner of Wilson 302 </sli>
<sli>C. The vertical nature of the bathroom layout</sli>
<sli>D. The temperature inside always being unpredictable and oddly inappropriate for the season</sli>
<sli>E. The fact that it's called Wilson Hall, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Wilson, you will truly be missed. Watch now as the band grieves the loss of our 69th favorite building and plays Timber.

This week is the Jewish holiday of Passover, so how could we pass up this opportunity to pass on some Passover knowledge to those who pass through the Main Green. At the Seder, or the traditional Passover meal, you have to have FOUR GLASSES OF WINE. This sounds like every other night for us, and now we just have an excuse to do it! In other news, Easter is almost here, which means Lent is almost over! This year, we gave up Lent for Lent, so if we stop giving up Lent at the end of Lent, are we back in Lent? We feel like we've been doing a pretty good job so far. Watch now as the band celebrates the holidays, and raises four glasses.

Like many other Brown students, we've all recently had the privilege to receive free copies of Rich Shapero's multimedia literary masterpiece, <em>Arms from the Sea</em>. For those of you who haven't had the chance to read the epic tale of Lyle's encounters with a "monstrous, seductive god" and his romance with a polyp, we thought we'd treat you all to a live reading.
</sp>
<sp>
The tip was inches from Lyle's face. It began to wriggle.<sbr/>
"What you long for--" The Polyp's voice was rich with emotion.<sbr/>
My dream, Lyle thought.<sbr/>
"Your dream--to create life and tend it. This dream," the Polyp whispered, "is as real as you want it to be." <sbr/>
Lyle raised his hand. The wriggling tip touched his palm.<sbr/>
"Lord of the deep," the Polyp said.<sbr/>
Watch now as the Band forms one of Polyp's tentacles and plays Bring the Tentacles.

That's all for now. Apparently we're opening for ourselves at spring weekend, so we'll see you then!<sbr/>
