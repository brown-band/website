Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants to know <i>"do ya like jazz?"</i> <sd>said like Jerry Seinfeld in the iconic role of Barry B. Benson in Bee Movie</sd>, it's the Brown University "get you a Band that can do both" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>

According to all known laws of ice skating, there is no way the Brown Band should be able to skate. Their instruments are too big to get their fat little bodies out of the stands. The band, of course, skates anyways. Because bandies don't care what CPax thinks is impossible.

You're skating on the ice. There's no one around, and your phone is dead. Out of the corner of your eye, you spot them. The Brown Band. They're following you around, about 30 feet back, they get out their instruments and start playing Ki-Yi-Yi. They're getting louder! The Brown Band. You're looking for the exit, but you're all turned around. They're really close now, and you can see there's drums in the Band! My god, there's drums everywhere!

Skating for your life (from the Brown Band) They're playing on a fife (the Brown Band) Skating all around you. Actual Ice skating Brown Band. Based out of Fulton (the Brown Band) Marching across campus (the Brown Band) Waking you up too early! Actual disturbance Brown Band. Watch now as the band forms Shia LaBeouf and throws it back to when he was last relevant (2012) and plays Gangnam Style.
