Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wrote this after spending 8 hours in the Ratty, it’s the Brown University "which came first, the French fry or the tater tot?" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We’d like to extend our warmest welcome to our alumni, which is ironic since it’s not warm at all in here. And it’s February, which means it may also be cold if we go outside. Here’s a list of our favorite "alternative" facts about February.

:::script-list

- A. The month of February was named after my second cousin "Feb," who grew up on a dairy farm just outside Savannah, Georgia.
- B. There are 28 days in February, but only because the constellation "Februs" has 28 stars. However, every four years, it has 29 stars.
- C. The first "R" in February was added to the name of the month after complaints from the American Pirates Association of America that there weren’t enough "r"s in the names of months.
- D. Before Valentine’s Day was a holiday about love, it was a holiday celebrating potatoes, but then people loved potatoes so much that they changed the point of the holiday.
- E. According to a recent study, 69% of clocks agree that February has never happened before, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Clearly, there was a lot our alumni neglected to learn while here. Did anything else change? Watch now as the Band attempts to answer this question and more and plays the national anthem of February.

After a brief hiatus, we’re back and ready to go, but you alums may have noticed a few changes since you last spent youth’s fleeting hours ’neath the shade of these time-honored walls. For example, the Ratty is now bluer than the Blue Room, although still not as blue as our favorite mascot, Untitled (Lamp/Bear). After trying to build on distinction, the Corporation decided that a complete rebranding was needed. :sd[Pause] Welcome to Blue University! Watch now as the Band honors our founders, the Blues Brothers, and plays Soul Man.

We interrupt your regularly scheduled ice show for this urgent news blast: Apparently the "Soup or Bowl" is tomorrow. We aren’t really sure what this means, as we are used to having soup and bowls, never separate from each other. Oh? What’s this? Someone’s saying it has something to do with football. YAY SPORTS TEAM! Go Patrifalcons! Tim Brody is my favorite member of Nickelback! I want to marry him! Well in any case, we hear it’s a football show opening for a Hamilton concert. We really thought the Browns would make it this year, but apparently that’s not the case. That’s the same as our team right? No? It’s not? Well, at least we’ll have a former Bear on the field. Anyway, just thought you might want to know, now back to the good part.

That’s all for this week! Join us next Saturday as we skate to glory and discover the meme-ing of life. Brown Band out!
