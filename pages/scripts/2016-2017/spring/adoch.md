Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has spent many days and nights on college hill, it’s the Brown University “the nights are way more fun” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

In 150 words or less, please respond to the following prompt: We all exist within communities or groups of various sizes, origins, and purposes; pick one and tell us why it is important to you, and how it has shaped you.

Well, we thought you’d never ask! This is the Band - founded in 1924 on a drunken dare, this organization has grown in size and stayed ever true to our roots by remaining just as “hydrated” and just as immature. In the 1980s, we were banned from Holy Cross and West Point, and we’ve formed friendships that will last a lifetime. Yes, we play music, but we also play ourselves. In the Band, it doesn’t matter what instrument you make noise with or what that noise sounds like, but that you try hard, have fun, and enjoy forming allegedly-phallic forms on the field. But hey, how were we supposed to know that forming an exploding soda can between two red solo cups would anger the Harvard athletic director? It’s not our fault other people have dirty minds. The end of this sentence makes exactly 150 words, so now hear us play!

It’s good to be here at “Brown’s Got Talent” (referring, of course, to Brown University, and not the decidedly talentless Cleveland Browns). We finally have the opportunity to show off our one true talent: running around and screaming. Of course, there are plenty of other things that we think we’re pretty okay at, such as:

:::script-list

- A. Procrastinating on the main green, the quiet green, and also literally everywhere else
- B. Taking up 10 tables in the hallowed halls of Josiah’s Snack Bar and Grill or the Sharpe Refectory, creating fire hazards
- C. Basking in the glory of all the beautiful new art we were graced with this year, such as our pal Blueno, better known as Untitled (Lamp/Bear)
- D. Identifying and opposing social constructs
- E. Greeting the smiling, eager faces of our fellow Brunonians at 9 am outside their windows with the sweet, sweet sounds of Stacy’s Mom during Family Weekend, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band forms the smile of our morning audience and plays “You Woke Me Up And I Will Punch You In the Face, Brown Band, I Swear If You Do This One More Time...”

Why Brown? Do it, you won’t. Brown Band out.
