There is a new trend in American Education. The teacher is giving way to the band master. College students Learn as much at half-time as they do in class time. Ladies and Gentlemen! This has gone too far! Today, in gentle protest, we are presenting a show designed to put an end to all this foolishness, a show so fantastically complex that even we don’t understand it. Ladies and Gentlemen, THE BROWN BAND.

:sd[On repeat of Victory March, band columns to Harvard and stops in block]

You’ve seen bands form stick figures? Let’s put a stop to this! The Band, after conferring with the Biology Department, is able to present here for the first time on any field a complete diagram of the circulatory system of the adult human male.

Bands have formed locomotives and steamboats, charging horses and airplanes. But have they showed what makes these things tick? The Brown Band, through special permission from the Atomic Energy Commission, now pre sents the complete wiring diagram of the world’s first atomic submarine, the Nautilus.

Bands have formed well-known college buildings. But has any band dared to present anything new in architecture? The Brown Band now goes into a blueprint of its new rehearsal hall.

:sd[Band rolls into Bruno for 15 seconds into a rectangle. Stops.]

Our thanks to Tom Lehrer for permission to offer this march tribute to Harvard: Fight Fiercely, Harvard.
