This is 1 year of change for Brown University. Our football team boasts a new coach, Len Jardine, and spanking new uniforms. The Brown Bank also has a new mentor in Frank “Bananas” Maranaccio, and next week we too will sport new uniforms. Shunning the traditional garb of other marching bands, we have rid ourselves of epauleis, profuse use of brass buttons, gay plumes and bulging breastplates. In our anxious quest for change we have even cut donn out traditional white trousers to give you, piece by piece, a taste of what’s to come.

:sd[the band forms a circle]

The word which best describes the change in life in the Brown community is metamorphosis. Since it would require 252 bandmembers to form this word, or any other word meaning change, on the field, the eighty members of the Brown Band will show you what they can do, forming the smallest piece of change they could find, a penny.

As the band plays “There’ll Be Some Changes Made.”

:sd[band plays “There’ll be Some Changes Made.”]\
:sd[then the band forms a football on the field.]

The greatest change on the scene is the Jardine Machine. We know that everyone is happy to see top notch football returning to Brown. As a symbol of our faith in the Jardine Machine the Band forms a football and we ask you all to rise and join in singing “Ever True to Brown.”

:sd[band plays “Ever True”]\
:sd[band forms a pickup stick on field]

A final change in the university is the new parietal system. Now the possibilities of entertaining ycung ladies from vassar girls to townies—or Pembrokers have been greatly extended. Certain relaxing games could be played including old maid, pin the tail on the donkey, or even pickup sticks. While forming said pickup stick, the Band suggests that when the houses consider the length of visiting hours they remember that famous Winston cigarette commercial.

:sd[the band plays the tune from that Winston commercial]\
:sd[the band marches off the field as the crowd strangles.]

::script-note[I think the commerical referenced is “[It’s Not How Long You Make It… It’s How You Make it Long](https://youtu.be/2BXiyMDD9Hk).” — JF]
