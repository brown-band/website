Ladies and Gentlemen, Presenting the Brown University Marching Band: Frank Marranianoccio, Director; Don Kent, President; and Ken Pasternak, Drum Major. Today the brown band salutes the many sides of one of Pennsylvania’s most famous residents, Benjamin Franklin.

First we salute Ben Franklin the nature lover. In recognition of this interest the band has formed one of his loves, grass. His advice on grass today might be, Philadelphia is nice but go west my many sons for the grass is much greener in San Francisco. The Band plays “Tea for Two”.

Speaking of contented cows, the Band, forming a welcome mat, salutes the up and coming Penn hockey team. We ask their support in beating off the aggies of Cornell. While forming said doormat the band plays “Do You Believe in Magic”.
