Holy cow! The Brown Band has gone hog wild making their first flight ever to the big ten…er…time city of Ithaca. Hay, we really lofted our big bird in—making it in one hour and \_\_\_\_ minutes. We thought Cornell was fodder away and almost flew pasture airport. But we tractor down and grazed in to a peas-ful landing. On the ground we herd some horse Cornell co-eds sheepishly singing “Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machine…” ...the Band has formed an <u>ear</u>ful of corn.

We’ve taken a good look at your gorgeous campus and were struck by the great cornell crevices. We understand that in order to bridge the gap between man and nature at cornell a crevice watching society was formed whose membership, rather than growing by leaps and bounds, has fallen sharply. A salute to the drop-outs—as the Band forms said crevass and plays “I Want to Be around to Pick up the Pieces.”

Speaking of sacred cows, The Band has formed a slightly squashed, blue baseball cap. We have little to say concerning this famed Cornellian institution except that “We’ll See You In December”—Ned!
