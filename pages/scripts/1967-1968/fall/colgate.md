## Long Version

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni presenting the Brown University Marching Band. Don Kent, President; Frank Marinaccio, Director; Don Herron, Mark Hochberg, Drum Majors

:sd[Band is blocked up on goal line.]

Friends, before we start the halftime entertainment today, the Band has an issue to settle. Over the past few years a journalist for a certain Providence newspaper has often criticized the brown band for its lack of precision marching, contrasting them with such marching units as That Ram Band. The Band would now like to make a comparison of its own as it plays “Washington Post.”

:sd[Band parades up and down field as it plays “Washington Post.”]

Well, fans, wasn’t that entertaining?

:sd[Band forms a hearth on the field.]

Now the band salutes revered American institutions. The greatest institution of them all is being honored by this Parents Weekend. We display our love for parents—a continual source of warmth—as we form a hearth and play “Keep the Home Fires Burning.”

:sd[Band plays “Keep the Home Fires Burning”]

Well, fans, wasn’t that entertaining?

:sd[Band forms a piece of pie.]

The Band has formed a piece of pie. At the Brown Refectory one sees the obvious decline of popularity of that American institution—apple pie. Instead, the Band forms Mrs. Feeney’s notorious air pie. The Band plays “Up, Up, and Away in My Beautiful Balloon.”

:sd[Band plays “Up, Up, and Away.”]\
:sd[Band forms a tombstone.]

The Band has formed a tombstone. It has been rumored lately that the most revered institution of all has passed away. Decrying the thought of the death of him, we hopefully play “It Ain’t Necessarily So.”

:sd[Band plays “It Ain’t Necessarily So.”]\
:sd[Band forms a blob.]

The Band now has formed the most beloved institution on College Hill—The Brown University Marching Band. On bended knee they repent for any past transgressions and pray for your forgiveness.

:sd[Band play same song as in previous formation.]

:sd[Band marches off field as crowd strangles.]

## Short Version

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting the Brown University Marching Band. Don Kent, President; Frank Marriannoccio, Director; Mark Hochberg, Don Herron, and Ken Pasternack, Drum Majors.

A prominent journalist on a certain Providence newspaper has often criticized the Brown Band for its lack of precision marching. Contrasting us with such units as U.R.I., the band would now like to do a comparison of its own AS THE BAND PLAYS THE WASHINGTON POST.

:sd[band still in block]

Well fans, wasn’t that entertaining. Now to the meat of the show.

:sd[band forms dollar sign]

Today the Band salutes changes in traditional American institutions. The Band has formed a dollar sign in salute to motherhood. the institution of motherhood is being supplanted by the institution of the career woman. Mothers who have traditionally found their place in the home, now find it out in the world. The Band plays “I Have Often Walked Down the Street Before”.

:sd[band plays]\
:sd[band forms a piece of pie.]

The band has formed a piece of pie. At the Brown Refectory one sees the obvious decline of apple pie’s popularity. Instead the band forms mrs Feeney’s notorious air pie. The Band plays “Up, Up, and Away in My Beautiful Balloon.”

:sd[band plays]\
:sd[band does no????] :sd[payton yells]: Hey Band you want to go to a pattie?\
:sd[band yells] YES\
:sd[band forms a pattie of butter]

The Band has indeed formed a pattie of butter. No longer does the American farmer churn his own cream. Instead he merely asks for the high priced spread. The Band plays the theme from Butterfield 8.
