Today, the Band surveys the spectrum of collegiate activities as they vary prom zero to one, from the sublime to the ridiculous. If there ever was a zero baby, it's that frolicking group, groping for knowledge while holding hands in a circle — the Brown Folk Dance Club. The Band plays one of the group’s best-loved Cuban Melodies — Havana Gila, and dances that Italian favorite — the hora.

Speaking of number one raw deals, the cards sure were stacked against us in St. Louis by the NC Double Ace. The Band would like to give them a royal flush as we play “Soccer to Me Baby”

In admiration of the sublime battle at Cornell last week, the Band has formed a tie on tie field, and says we love the team whether it Windsor Knot. The Band plays “Those Magnificent Men and Their Jardine Machine.”

The Band has formed a television set on the field. With this ridiculous formation the band turns off the boob tube of halftime entertainment tor the year, and channels its efforts elsewhere. Please remember to tune us in next fall and don’t touch those kobs so we can once again turn you on.
