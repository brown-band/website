Today the Brown Band presents the thrilling history of the American brown bear, _Ursus brunensis americanus_. The bear first appeared on the American scene at the time of Daniel Boone who pronounced bear, “bar”. This pronunciation has been followed even to the present day by the Brown man who never passes up a shot at a bar. Saluting this fact, the Band has formed a beer bottle and plays the “Bear Bottle Polka”.

The bear reappears in the ’30’s —— this time in the person of Gypsy Rose Lee. The Band honors her contributions to show business and plays “Let Me Entertain You.”

In a recent <u>New York Times</u> article it was announced that Yale University is converting most of its available funds into common stock. Saluting Eli’s plunge into a “bear” market, the Band forms a blue chip. We hope the Yalie takes said chip off his shoulder and gives it to a broker. The Band plays a “Taste of Money”.
