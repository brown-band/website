## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni - presenting the only campus organization with more spunk than the International Socialist Organization, it's the Brown - University - BAND!

:sd[Band runs onto field]

Exciting news, band! Today, our football team will be playing against USD. Do you know where that is, Band? That's right, California. And do you know what California has that we don't? California girls. Maybe that's why Men's Health considers us so anti-male. Watch now as the band forms the football of love and expresses its desire for the women of the west coast.

:sd[Band plays "Everyone Needs Somebody To Love"]

So, band, where is California? (dramatic pause) Um, I don't know either. OK, so the band may not know as much about geography as, say, a USD student. But at least we don't have to go to school in sunny Southern California. We get cold, rainy, humid, sweltering, miserable, divine Providence 10 months out of the year. Bet that makes you jealous, huh?  
Watch now as the band forms a B for bad weather and plays "bring the geography."

:sd[Band does this]

Thank you all for being here for USD's last appearance here before California breaks off and sinks into the ocean. Join us in honoring the continental 48 -- soon to be 47 -- states (and Alaska and Hawaii, too.) Please rise for the National Anthem.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, dudes and dudettes, friends and alumni, freshmen and other low-growing shrubbery, presenting the one, the only, the envied-and-reviled the world over, Brown University Band!

:sd[Band takes field (Q) and extends it by adjoining the square root of 2]

Ki yi yi productions, in conjunction with Irving Harris, presents the story that shocked nations and inspired millions. A young time traveller named Elrod, portrayed by Keanu Reeves, stumbles upon a plot to undermine his beloved University and their valiant football team. Listen now to the exciting theme music.

:sd[Band plays "Give up the Funk" and forms a copyright insignia]

Your heart will thrill as Elrod strives to change the minds of the Evil Organization that threatens the integrity of the Brown Team. You will see Action! Adventure! Romance! Dumb jokes! Swing dancing! People crashing through plate glass windows! Watch now as the band demonstrates the last two and plays "Opus One."

:sd[Band (minus flutes) forms a square. The flutes form a small amorphous blob outside of the box. At some point the flutes crash through the box. The box disperses.]

Elrod's journey through time and space takes him to such exotic destinations as the bathhouses of Ancient Rome! The ruins of Montezuma! And the thirteenth floor of the Sci Li. OH BABY. He begins his journey in San Diego, where you'll witness the exciting chase through the Jenny Craig pavilion as our hero is pursued by stunning California girls wielding Slim Fast! Watch now as the band forms a can of lethal meal supplement and plays No Way, Broad.

:sd[Band ... uh ... does it]

You won't want to miss the acting talents of Leelee Sobieski, Sean Connery, and Oprah in a movie that flies in the face of everything you know about gender, race, social impact, the grease left on your hands from tater tots, and the Brown football team. This movie is brought to you by the numbers 6, 9, and the letter B. Watch now as the band salutes our sponsor, and plays some more exciting music from the movie.

:sd[Band plays B, forms 2. Um wait ...]

Join us next week for the first installment of "Elrod's nifty quest (through space and time)." Watch for the soundtrack, featuring such greats as Lisa Loeb, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and of course, the BAND!

:sd[Band marches off to number 1]
