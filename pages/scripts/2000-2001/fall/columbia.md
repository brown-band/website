## Pregame

Our seniors have been here a while,\
their memories will give us a smile\
their presence we’ll miss\
as we run down the list\
now if we could just get rid of Kyle ...

Carolyn’s our fearless leader\
she always is there when you need her\
she used to play reeds\
but responded to our needs\
now her spit valve dumps out a liter

Our head conductor is Nick\
he studies why people get sick\
he has quite a knack\
for playing the sax\
and also for waving his stick

Josh the corsec once was\
he took up a valiant cause\
to be drowning in liquor\
or watching a stripper\
whose weight was against the state laws

Marty has really red hair\
he’s loud so you know when he’s there\
but when playing the flute\
you can’t hear a toot\
so he switched to the trombone last year

Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark beer\
Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark beer\
Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark\
Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark\
Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark beer

Princess Alycia is grand\
she holds Mike in the palm of her hand\
she directs S and M\
she’s a dominating femme\
when she says attention, you stand!

Chuck keeps a mighty fine beat\
he has trouble with skates on his feet\
from old San Antone\
he’s bad to the bone\
he’s not gone, he’ll be right down the street!

The low end of the reeds is Veronica\
she’s more fun than the 8 nights of Chanukah\
she comes decked in leather\
no matter the weather\
this limerick’s clean - how ironica!

There once was a stringbean named Steve\
who was so long you wouldn’t believe\
he rushed the bass drum\
and got thrown out on his bum\
and came back cause he just wouldn’t leave - I mean come!

Our quad player Brian F. Locke\
kept plenty of booze in his stock\
he takes lots of chugs\
and gives lots of hugs\
he’s the sketchiest guy on the block

There once was a sketchball named James\
whose girls were too many to name\
the trumpet’s a ball\
but they found it too small\
so he picked up the sousaphone in shame

Jonah McBride is our veep\
with the corsec he often does sleep\
the child of a stonah\
he drinks lots of Corona\
and he hasn’t showered in a week.\
arooooooooo!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s about to lose it’s better fourth, it’s the Brown University - shoulda gone with the five-year plan - BAND!

:sd[Band stumbles onto field in the manner of a super-senior heading to 9 am class]

All season long we’ve been following the epic story of the band’s hero, Elrod Snidley. Originally we planned to end that story in this halftime show. Well, it ain’t gonna happen. We pre-empt the season finale to bring you something with even more intrigue, seduction, and scandal - epic election coverage! Watch now as the band tries to prevent a miscarriage of justice in Florida and forms a metaphor for the state’s electoral votes.

:sd[Band forms a trophy, plays “Smooth”]

Last week, Brown announced our next president, something that we don’t anticipate the United States managing for another year or so. To make Dr. Simmons’s transition to Brown as comfortable as possible, the band will now form a comfortable shoe and play “Play That Funky Music Brown Boys” :sd[band shouts “and Girls”]

:sd[Band forms shoe, plays “Play That Funky Music Brown Boys”]

So, to summarize - Brown has a new president, the rest of the country can’t quite figure it out, and Harvard and Princeton can’t even narrow it down to two candidates. And Columbia students? Well, they were awfully confused by the SAT’s, so filling out a New York ballot was probably far beyond them - though it is multiple choice.

:sd[Band forms “B”, plays “Brown Bear”]

Join us next year, when the Bears take on the University of San Diego on their home turf, and the band continues to make jokes about the still-undecided election results.

:sd[Band marches off to “Ever True”]
