## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, Bostonians and bad drivers - wait, they’re the same thing - presenting the organization that you love to hate and hate to love. It’s the one, the only, the home for the first time all over again - BAND!

:sd[Band runneth onto the field]

Welcome back alumni for that great event we call homecoming.  
The highlight of this for many is watching the Brown team take on the Harvard team.  
Brains being better than brawn, of course, we usually win.

:sd[Band plays "Championship"]

Recently, Harvard and Brown have instituted a dual early action program that enables students to apply to Brown AND Harvard early.  
Supposedly, this will allow students more freedom, and less worries in the application process. However, it is the band’s opinion that Harvard just wants our applicant pool. Watch now as the band forms the letter of the only Ivy League school that matters and plays Brown and only Brown Forevermore.

:sd[Band does exactly that]

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting this fall’s biggest sensation, it’s the Brown University - why, yes, we do have size 17 feet - BAND!

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the Evil Empire (TM) controls most of space. A small band of freedom fighters are surrounded on all sides by the forces of Crimson and Navy Blue. They are the galaxy’s last hope against the tyranny of unoriginal thought and complacency. What are their chances?  
Stay tuned to find out. Watch now as they calculate their probability of success and play 25 for, 6-to-9 against.

:sd[Band forms 0, or 1, (or maybe 1/2, etc.), and plays "25 or 6 to 9"]

Desparate, our heroes concoct a daring plan to lure the Empire to Brown, where they will destroy the forces of darkness entirely. As they lay their trap, one of the warriors is caught off guard by a suprise attack and is captured. Ever defiant, the student bravely holds out against all forms of torture - being forced to listen to tapes of old Al Gore speeches, wear crimson, and hear whiny Harvard students complain all day. Will he break? Stay tuned to find out!

:sd[Band forms question mark, plays "Think"]

Eventually, however, our brave student can take no more. Defeated, he tells all, under the condition that the Harvard students (I’m not sure what goes here). The crimson forces, aware of the trap, attack, hoping for a decisive victory. Watch now as the battle starts, and our boys get "In the Fray".

:sd[Band forms B, plays "In the Fray"]

Will Brown prevail? Will wholesome goodness be restored to the galaxy? Will the Harvard Band get rid of that ridiculous bass drum? Tune in next week to find out - same time, same channel, as the bears take on URI and the Band’s epic saga continues.

:sd[Band plays #1 and marches off]
