## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that doesn’t come from the most overweight city in the union, it’s the Brown University “I’m not fat, I’m just big boned,” Band!

:sd[Band oooooozes onto the field]

While the residents of Philadelphia have been eagerly stuffing their faces with hoagies, cheese steaks, and pretzel batter - for credit - we’ve been sucking down the lower-fat pleasures of the city, like water ice; only 20 calories! Watch now as the band forms the only part of a pig that a Philadelphian won’t eat and plays “gonna fry now.”

In recent years, we’ve tried to explain to Penn students that killing brain cells is not the best way to lose weight. With any luck, our football team will show them another way today and give them a run for their money. Watch now as the band forms its favorite letter and plays [a brown song]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that saw your mom this morning and thought she was early for halloween, it’s the Brown University - we roll more than oats - Band!

:sd[Band takes the field trying not to fall on the Astro turf]

Hello and welcome to another installment of “Elrod Snidley Presents.” In this week’s episode, Elrod awakes to a world where everything is turned upside down and nothing is as it seems - but then he realizes that he’s just in Philadelphia.

:sd[Band forms Hitchcock’s profile and plays “Psycho.” In the meantime, Evan stabs a showering Kristen with his clarinet]

Elrod awakes in a blinding terror that quickly turns into a destructive rage usually reserved for Japanese stop-action animation. He tears down the Franklin Institute, Independence Hall, and the Penn Tower. Watch now as the band, led by Elrod, takes refuge for the night atop Bald Mountain.

:sd[Band forms a mountain and plays “Night on Bald Mountain.” The percussion section then “blows its top.”]

Join us next week in Providence, when elrod awakes from his awful nightmare safe and sound, after levelling philly - for credit, and we neuter the bulldogs of Yale - for credit.
