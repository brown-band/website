## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that seems to always visit Princeton right after President Clinton, it's the Brown University - why, yes, Mr. President - Band!

:sd[Band perambulates about the field]

The timing of Clinton's visit might suggest that he is under consideration for the post that President Shapiro will be giving up. Of course, Clinton was discarded early on as a candidate for the Brown Presidency. Some of the reasons: we already have waffles every morning in the dining halls, the women of Brown just weren't interested in his internship opportunities, and we're running out of jokes about him.

:sd[Band plays "Championship"]

But a Clinton presidency wouldn't be all bad. He would no doubt bring many improvements to the Princton campus: a resurgence in pole dancing - I mean, wrestling; he could give saxophone lessons to the Princeton band; and 6 to 10 more years of guaranteed bad jokes from the Brown Band. Watch now as the band ponders a second Clinton Presidency, and plays [some Brown song].

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting the only organization on the Princeton campus capable of chewing its own food, it's the Brown University - I tawt i taw a puddy tat - Band!

:sd[Band runs on, does its thing]

When we left you 3 weeks ago, the rumpled and dejected band was huddling for survival, while their fearless leader Elrod Snidley was off in California being chased by a mob of fast blond women with big cans of slim-fast. Watch now as Elrod and fellow wronged genius Wen Ho Lee leave the sunnier climes of the west coast to go undercover at Princeton and save the band.

:sd[Band forms sunglasses, plays "Secret Asian Man"]

Arriving at Princeton, Elrod demanded, "take me to your leader." Unfortunately, President Shapiro was not available, as he was meeting with the other Ivy League presidents to vote E Gordon Gee off the "college edition" of Survivor. Unfortunately, after also voting off Neil L. Rudenstine of Harvard, he found himself next to be kicked out of the ivory tower and onto the ivory beaches of some south pacific island. Watch now as the band sends them off to tropical paradise, and plays "Jungle Boogie."

:sd[Band forms palm tree, plays "Jungle Boogie"]

Left without other options, Elrod met with Janina Montero and persuaded her to join the tide of adminstrators leaving Princeton like rats from a sinking ship. Arriving in Providence, Janina threatened the other Ivy League bands: "My name is Janina Montero; You voted my president onto the island; Prepare to die." Will she be able to hold off the uncouth hordes of Cornell, Columbia, and Dartmouth students? And what about the dim-witted aspiring presidents of Harvard and Yale? Tune in next week to find out!

:sd[Band forms a B and plays a Brown Song - you know the drill]

Join us next week in Provindence, when the Bears take on the Big Red :sd[Band shouts "Big red What?"] of Cornell, and the the Band faces off against people who are willing to waste a credit to dress up in silly uniforms and pretend to be in a chewing gum commercial.

:sd[Band marches off Daddy's field to #1]
