## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, moms, pops, and crazy uncle gonzo who lives locked up in the attic; presenting a disorganization that really loves your mom, it's the Brown University - "our Freudian slip is showing" - BAND!

:sd[Band toddles onto field, forms a crest]

We'd like to welcome the parents of our student body to today's game, especially parents of our freshmen. Congratulations on finding the stadium! You may notice changes in your freshmen. After all, they're living away from you for the first time. Without you to remind them, they may have forgotten to do simple, everday tasks like washing their clothes or brushing their teeth. Watch now as the band reminds the class of 2004 about personal hygiene by forming a crest.

:sd[Band forms a crest and plays "Final Countdown." During the song, the flutes and clarinets leave the formation in protest, chanting "NO WAY, WE WONT PLAY, THEY CAN'T HEAR US ANYWAY!"]

You probably haven't heard from your child in a while. They might call you more often if you sent them money. Of course, you could just call them if they weren't out partying all night. Watch now as the band sets a good example by (1) being awake before 4 p.m. on a Saturday and (2) calling home to check in.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, Erwin and Evan's mom and Judith Ann, presenting an organization that wishes Courtney's mom had come (for the game), it's the Brown University "Ma, I'm running out of tube socks"

Midterm season is here, so lots of students may seem a bit stressed out. Fortunately, Brown's committment to liberal learning provides classes to help them relax, such as International Relations 13 - picking up Euro chicks at Viva; Environmental Science 42 - group showers: seminar in advanced water conservation; comp lit 57 - the complete works of the Marquis DeSade; and engin 6 section 9 - advanced massage techniques for electrical engineers. Watch now as the band forms a massage implement and plays "It's Electric!"

For those of you who have been following the season we present the next chapter of Elrod Snidley's wacky hijinks. Last week, Elrod, the plucky band mascot, and Janina Montero, portrayed by Liz Hurley, left Princeton to rescue the Brown Band from their archnemesis, the Cornell Band. They did such a good job that the Cornell Band is in a heap at the bottom of the gorge trying out a new formation - the double rotating ah splat. Our heroes found the Brown Band lying on the floor complaining of splitting headaches and rubbing their bloodshot eyes. When asked what they'd been doing they claimed that they'd gotten sick from studying too hard. Of course we know that what they told their parents was a Saturday night fever was actually a Sunday morning hangover. Watch now as the band rolls its blood shot eye.

:sd[Band forms an I and plays "Saturday Night Fever." Eye mean I. Yeah.]

Speaking of bloodshot eyes, I just flew in from Thebes and boy do my sockets hurt, but I still love you Mommy! After all, you do my laundry. But now that the freshmen are on their own they've had to learn how to do things for themselves, like cooking, walking, and chewing their own food. Freshman guys have turned the spin cycle into a sporting event. Watch now as the band helps the class of 2004 become bench pressed and wrinkle free and plays "iron, man!"

:sd[Band forms an iron and plays "Iron Chan"]

Bet you wonder what your kids are listening to now that it's no longer your lectures. The Brown Band will happily clue you in.
