## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that isn't voting for Bush, Gore, or Nader, it's the Brown University "Vote Snidley" Band!

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a city, a wonderous city, full of smells that no one had ever smelled before. And in the city, there was a university full of wonderous smells that no one had ever smelled before. With good reason. Let's all welcome Yale and their wonderous smells to the game.

The Yale Band won't be here today. In fact the only band that did turn up for a game this season was Harvard's. So maybe we're the ones who smell funny. Actually, the Yale Band did come, and we just ate them. So you won't be seeing them for a while. Watch now as the band picks today's winner (for entertainment purposes only), and plays [some Brown song]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting the only band here today that hasn't soiled a fire hydrant in New Haven, it's the Brown University "Who let the Dogs Out?" Band!

Last week in the chronicles of Elrod found us in Philadelphia, where our hero was demolishing historic sights in a manner not dissimilar to Godzilla, Mothra, or a major contracting firm. In the end, he fled to Bald Mountain, where he was tormented by demons for 40 days. With the charge of God fresh in his mind, Elrod returns to Providence to help the band beat the blues.

At this point in the show, we'd like to pause and remind all those in the audience to vote on Tuesday. Although many claim that there's no difference between Bush and Gore, the band knows better. Gore, for example, speaks fluent English. We're not sure what language Bush speaks, but careful analysis has allowed us to find etymologies for some items in his vocabulary. "Japanians" seems to be derived from the Heiroglyph "Bread-Mouth-Squiggle," which roughly translates to "People who are smarter than me." Watch now as the band calls for a return to old-time family values. And languages!

Of course, there are other reasons to avoid voting for Bush. He went to Yale. Gore, on the other hand, attended some hick school in Cambridge. But the band won't really tell you how to use your vote. This is America, and you can vote for any dumb rich guy you want. Watch now as the band forms the highest grade that either candidate received as an undergraduate and plays a Brown song.

That's all for today, folks - thanks for tuning in. Join us next week when the band braves the frozen wastelands to the north to take on the big lack of experience that is Dartmouth.
