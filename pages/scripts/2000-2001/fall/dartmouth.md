## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wears wool undergarments, it's the Brown University - "I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine" - BAND!

:sd[Band runs onto field]

Wait - wait - this just in - it seems that it is too close to call which band is on the field ... In fact, it seems that the Dartmouth Band is on. [In a hick voice] We'd like to welcome all y'all from Providence to this here city of ours. We'd also like to apoligize for our actions in the last election. 'Course, we still don't know who the president is, but if New Hampshire and Or-e-gon hadn't gone to Bush, then Florida wouldn't matter. The top ten reasons that Dartmouth students voted for a Yalie?

:::script-list

- 10. Couldn't tell the difference between Buchanan and Gore
- 9. Couldn't tell the difference between Buchanan and Bush
- 8. Illiterate
- 7. Too busy makin' up top ten lists
- 6. Crimson looks bad on Green
- 5. Bush has an Ivy-league edumacation
- 4. Identified with his cocaine habit
- 3. After abusing alcohol for years, he's finally dry - just like Dartmouth
- 2. They voted for the Green Party candidate - a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush
- 1. The sheep told me to do it! I swear!

Watch now as the Band forms a bad political metaphor for Florida and plays [something].

:sd[Band does just that]

Wait - wait - this just in - it seems that it is now once again too close to call what band is on the field ... In fact, yes, our latest reports identify the band as going to Princeton. :sd[upper crust voice] The Princeton Band recently discovered that in an effort to boost their applicant pool to meet minimum requirements of respectability, Dartmouth will be adopting a new advertising slogan. We'd like to suggest a few of our own:

:::script-list

- a) Dartmouth: It's what's for college
- b) Hanover: It's nowhere you want to be
- c) You're not going to pay a lot for this college ... oh, wait! Yes, you are
- d) Have you ridden a moose ... lately?
- e) ... and with a name like "Dartmouth," it has to be good...or at least you would think
- f) "The Brown Band"

We'll be back for halftime to bring you our special election coverage.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, flatlanders and farmers, presenting an organization that's glad we didn't "Take Vermont Back" - though it seems like New Hampshire might be broken, it's the Brown University - "It's all the green's fault" - Band!

:sd[Band protests election - no - actually, they run on]

Brown University just named our next President, Dr. Ruth Simmons. It took us nine months to figure that out, though we did finish before the United States as a whole. Princeton and Harvard, on the other hand, are still looking. What can we conclude? While Brown students are much smarter than the average American, students at those second-tier Ivies just don't measure up. And we hear that Dartmouth hasn't even started looking for a new President. Watch now as the band calculates _their_ average IQ.

:sd[Band forms a zero, plays "Good Golly, Miss Molly"]

Due to the results of the Presidential election, the band has decided to leave the United States for a land with an informed citizenry. Canada. After the game, we'll be headed off to the frozen wastes of the north, which are actually quite similar to Dartmouth - except for the infomed citizenry bit. Watch now as the band looks forward to an old-time Dartmouth diet of root-crops and vodka, and plays the latest chart-topping hit in Hanover.

:sd[Band forms turnip, plays "Old Time Rock'n Roll"]

Actually, we anticipate being able to return to the United States within a few years. By that point, global warming will have put Florida under several feet of ocean. And just think - by that point the climate will have undergone enough change to make Hanover habitable by humans. Rhode Island might be a little wet, but it rains 2 days out of 3 anyway in Providence, so we won't notice the difference.

:sd[Band forms "B," plays some Brown Song]

Join us next week in the warmer climes of Providence where the Bears will be winding down the season against the Lions (oh my!), and the band will be bidding adeiu to its graduating seniors.

:sd[Band marches off to #1]
