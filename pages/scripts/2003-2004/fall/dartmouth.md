## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization with more crust than an empty Ronzio’s box, it’s the Brown University “What rhymes with penguin?” BAND!

:sd[Band runs onto field, forms martini glass, plays “Bits and pieces.”]

Andy lives in the house of Techs\
And has a quite nice set of pecs\
He is really quite buff\
Like the “Oh Yeah!” guy Duff\
He’s a guy chemicals don’t vex.

Melissa’s the one with the ears\
Her fiancé is quite Cavalier\
She has all that hair\
That goes down to there\
She plays picc, but nobody hears.

El Kupé used to be Mom\
At playing sax she’s the bomb\
She went down to Sydney\
To damage her kidneys\
Now supplies liquid fun with aplomb.

Mike K’s our fave sweater vest boy\
His stick waving makes us say “Oy”\
He has a sweet ride\
The 8-Track’s bona fide\
Chose philosophy – he’s unemployed.

Paul Frake is quite the pre-med\
He consumes beer like it is bread\
He beats it with sticks\
BAC’s .36\
As VP he gave us all…dinner.

Kristen, our old Pres from Maine\
On clarinet and cymbals acclaimed\
She bangs or she blows\
We’ll be sad when she goes\
“Buttercup” just won’t be the same.

Evan was our business chief\
Who knows how to spice up our beef\
He’ll hit that high C\
When his home state secedes\
His work at Help Desk brings relief.

Here’s to our old CorSec Susan\
Who spent a year abroad boozin’\
She booked Wonderland\
But we still think she’s grand\
The trumpets don’t know what they’re losin’.

Frances, our lovable Brit\
We think trumpet is her best fit\
She’s very soft spoken\
She’s so hot she’s smokin’\
She wants to build the next rocket.

Pete is the scribe of our scripts\
He’s come up with a bevy of quips\
He “Arrr” sails the CS\
Admires Oedipus\
Terry, we’ll miss you on trips.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting the organization formerly known as the Brown University “So THIS is what it sounds like when doves cry!” Band, it’s the Brown University... um... \*bleargh\*!

Today’s time period highlights the greatest identity changes in human history: The “USSR” became “New South Wales,” Prince became \*bleargh\*, and Dartmouth changed its mascot from Sheila the Sheep to the Big Green. Still, some Dartmouth students are longing to rally behind a tangible icon, and have proposed to replace the Green with “Keggy the Keg.” May we also suggest:

:::script-list

- A) IBie, the I-banker
- B) Nort, the Nor’Easter
- C) Sticky, the Frat House floor
- D) Ducky, the annoying fellow from Pretty In Pink
- E) Homogeny, the Student Population
- F) The Princeton Band

:::

The band will make its choice with the letter formerly known as \*bleargh\* and play “Sheep”

:sd[Band forms a prince symbolish thing, plays “Smooth”]

Why change your identity, though, when you can just split it? You don’t have to choose between business and party, when the former can be in the front, and the latter in the back. The band maintains that success is a 10/90 ratio. A Kentucky Waterfall, if you will. A Lincoln Top Hat. A Yep or Nope. Perhaps, a Missouri Compromise. The band will secure its hipster status by waving its mud flaps as it forms the glorious mullet and plays “Cut It.”

:sd[Band forms a mullet, plays “Beat It”]

Michael Jackson reminds us that crises of identity are never black or white issues, but they’re nothing that can’t be solved by a little bit of dancing. We’d like to conclude this season’s historical retrospective with a nod to the greatest cultural achievement of the last 125 years: Dirty Dancing. The band will form Patrick Swayze’s biceps to assert that nobody puts Brown Bear in the corner.

:sd[Band forms a B, plays “Brown Bear”]

Next week we’ll be at Columbia :sd[Band: “Where?”] it’s in New York, band :sd[“Oh.”] for the last game of the season. Weather will be cloudy, with an 85% chance of Jazz Hands.
