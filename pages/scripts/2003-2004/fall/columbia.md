## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni! Presenting an organization whose a-rival has been a-foretold, it’s the Brown University “No, you are.” BAND!!!

The great rivalries of our time: Cubs and White Sox. Don Zimmer and Pedro Martinez. Harvard and Yale. Everyone and Harvard. And now, Brown and Columbia. A Columbia student recently proposed that his school and ours, both without recognized rivals, come together and agree to, well, not come together. So, in true rivalry spirit, we’d like to start things off by saying... Columbia smells like Jersey. Ready to watch it be fought out on the field, the band will get out the football and play “Championship.”

Sorry to build you up and let your down, Columbia, but we don’t think it will work out. Brown has too many rivals already: The Massachusetts Institute of Free Trade, SUNY Globalization, Colonialism Community College, Brandeis... We’re spread thinner than a chickenhawk’s army after a unilateral strike. So let’s just be friends. As a token of our good will, the band will form a C on the field and play “You Still Smell Like Jersey,” to the tune of Brown Cheering Song.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, Friends and alumni! Presenting an organization that’s got your Magic Johnson right here, it’s the Brown University “Globetrotter, I hardly know her!” BAND!!!

The Brown Band was on a train over to Columbia this morning when we dropped our cell phone down the toilet. Though we were smart enough not to retrieve it by hand, let’s just say that there’s a Sousaphone we can’t ever use again. Still, it went better than the time we lost our keys on the band bus and we had to fish them out with a coat hanger. The band will form the object that saved our morning ride and play “Crazy Train.”

The band loves being in New York, however.

Hang on a second... “What???... I can’t, I’m at the game.... Columbia! ... Columbia! ... No, Harlem. ... :sd[read off score] ... No, you’re thinking of the Massachusetts Institute of Free Trade. ... The Massachusetts, oh, forget it. ... What??? .... You’re breaking up. ... Look, “text” me.... I don’t know either, but it’s big in Europe... Hang on, I’ll call you back.”

:sd[band forms Cingular guy, plays “I Want You Back.”]

Sorry about that. We were talking about how much we love New York.

“Hello? ... Oh, hi Mrs. C” Columbia, it’s your mom. “Yeah, I can take a message. What? ... I can’t say that. ... Mrs. C you shouldn’t say that about. ... Mrs. C, I think you’re trying to seduce me. ... Alright, alright. Thanks for the brownies, by the way. ... Okay, bye Mrs. C”

Hey Columbia, your mom called, and she said ... “you do not meet her expectations for performance or effectiveness.” Getting its head back in the game, the Band will form a “B” and play “Bring the Victory.”

That’s it for the football season, but be in Providence next semester for the World Famous Brown Skating Band!
