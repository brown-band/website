Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Brown University Marching Band, Martin Fischer, Director; Laurence Pizer, President; And Jack Monrad, Drum Major, in a salute to Pembrokers and Pembroke on its 75th Anniversity.

:sd[Band forms wedding cake.]\
Although to most Brown-men going out with a Pembroker is a <u>court</u> of last resort, the oft quoted propaganda has it that 1 out of 2 of all ’brokers who do get married marry a Brown-man. The Band has formed a wedding cake and salutes that lucky Brown-man by playing “What Kind of Fool Am I?”

:sd[Band forms line on near hash.]\
In the world of women’s fashions things at Pembroke, as elsewhere, are looking up. The all male band has formed a him-line in recognition of current trends.\
:sd[Band plays “Air Force March.”]

:sd[Band forms line on far hash.]\
The Band salutes all those Pembrokers who are now self-consciously tugging at their skirts to lower their “see-levels”, and girls in general as it plays, “I Ain’t Down Yet.”\

:sd[Band forms stacks in the Rockefeller Library.] The Band has formed the stacks of the Rockefeller Library, a perpetual haunt of the studious Pembroker. In fact, when a Brown man refers to something as being stacked in the library, is he really thinking of his books? The Band plays, “There is Nothing Like a Dame”\

Now in concert formation, the Band plays selections from the Off-Broadway musical "The Fantasticks."
