Today the Band will search into President Johnson’s operation. How was the President’s condition originally determined? A doctor place his stethoscope to the president. The Band has formed Johnson’s hernia to commemorate the song the doctor heard, “I Hernia Knocking but You Can't Come In.”

What happened to the nation while the President was in the hospital? Some feared for his recovery but there is little to worry about, “When You Wish upon a Scar.”

Now the band looks into Ivy League soccer. We proudly hail Coach Stevenson and his varsity for continuing their string of Ivy League titles and also the freshman team for marking their third straight year without a defeat.\
