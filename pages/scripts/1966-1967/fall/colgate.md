Today the Band looks at prominent figures…in the world of politics. In the past few years, several former movie actors have become prominent in that Never-Never Land of California politics. Therefore, newly appointed Republican State Chairman, Jiminy Cricket, has announced a new theme song for this year’s campaign: “When You Wish Upon A <u>Star</u>.”\

How many of you remember Hubert Humphrey? (He used to be a senator.) Although this song is perhaps more appropriate to the present weekend at Pembroke, the Band salutes that great Texan from Minnesota and plays, “My Heart belongs to Daddy.”\

Finally, in concert formation, the Band salutes Brown’s sister college by playing, not “Everything’s Coming Up Roses,” but selections from the broadway musical “My Fair Lady.”\
