Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Brown University Marching Band Martin Ficher, Director; Laurence Pixer, President; And Jack Monrad, Drum Major, in a salute to the non-candidates on 1966.

Lyndon Johnson has finally answered the appeals of Democratic candidates throughout the nation. He has agreed to aid them in their bids for election—by leaving the country. The Band joins the candidates in bidding the President farewell as it plays, “So Long Its Been Good to Know You.”\

While President Johnson travels through Asia, back in the States the candidates are busily working on their own campaigns. However, a certain Senator from New York merely sits in his office and sings “I’m Bidin’ My Time.”

:sd[Band forms outline of Alabama]\
The Band has formed the sovereign state of Alabama. Although George Wallace will not himself be candidate for re-election this year he has found, in his wife, the only person truly worthy on becoming his successor. The Band salutes the premise that bedfellows make strange politics as it plays, “A Good <u>Man</u> is Hard to Find.”\
