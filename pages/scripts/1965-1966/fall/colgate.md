Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Brown University Marching Band: Martin Fischer, Director; Earl Holt, President; and Jack Monrad, Drum Major.

:sd[Band hidden; drums hidden but audible; drum major goes through routine to “formation”]

In honor of Colgate the band has formed an invisible shield… in this formation the band has used 99% fewer members.

:sd[Band runs out into $]

with a <u>Gleem</u> in its eye, the A & E committee of the university saluted parents webkind by guaranteeing—that in one area at least—Brown will be first in the ivy league. The Band voices the cry of all parents: “Help”

:sd[Band plays "help".]\

It’s hats off to that reknowned student publication, the Brown Daily Herald, now at the <u>Crest</u> of its popularity, whom the band salutes by forming a headline. With apologies to Colgate for recommending a competitve product, the band recognizes the BDH’s style of journalism by playing “You’ll Wonder Where the Yellow Went”.

:sd[Band forms BRU]

In a different <u>Stripe</u>, from the BDH we move up—to the third floor—where WBRU now broadcasts <u>ITS</u> truth five minutes every hour to an eagerly waiting campus. BRU will become an influential force on campus. However, it may take more than a little bit of luck: it may take “A Hundred Million Miracles”.

:sd[Band forms concert oval.]

We hope that the BDH and BRU will be able to <u>brush away</u> any base remarks they might feel tempted to make about the band in their editorials of next week. For its part, the Band now features its own <u>Bass</u> section as it plays G. H. Huffine’s famous march, “Them Basses”.
