Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the Brown University Marching band, Martin Fischer, Director; Earl Holt, President; and Jack Monrad, Drum Major.

The band has formed a prominent symbol of homecoming—for both alumni and undergraduates—a shot glass.

However, there is another symbol of homecoming that is not nearly so pleasant for the undergraduates involved. The Band has reversed the glass for all those who were “<u>shot down</u>” this weekend. We know we’ll find these gentlemen <u>Standing on the Corner</u>.

Through extensive research, the Band has discovered President Barnaby C. Keeney was born in: <u>Halfway</u>, Oregon. In recognition of this fact the Band has formed in the <u>middle</u> of the field and plays <u>half</u> of “All the Way”.

In this, his final year at Brown, the Band salutes Mr. Keeney for the part he has played in the growth of the University and the continued progress of Brown.

:sd[Band plays “Ever True”.]\
:sd[Band forms Rockefeller Library.]

Symbolic of the progress which Brown has seen during the last ten years is the Rockefeller Library which the band has depicted on the field. Across the street from the library is University Hall, symbol of two hundred years of Brown tradition. In recognition of Brown from its beginnings to the present day, we invite everyone to join in the singing of the Alma Mater.
