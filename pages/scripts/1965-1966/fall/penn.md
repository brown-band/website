Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Brown University Marching Band: Martin Fischer, Director; Earl Holt, President; And Jack Monrad, Drum Major.

Today the band salutes the many sides of one of Pennsylvania’s most famous residents, Benjamin Franklin.

:sd[Band marches out, forms cocktail glass.]

First we salute Franklin as moralist. Pennsylvania—as a result of recent incidents—may have to recognize Franklin’s emphasis on temperance, and switch a famous school song from “Have a Highball at Nightfall” to “Tea for Two.”

Next, we salute Benjamin Franklin as founder of the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin’s original plan did not include the coeds who now inhabit the campus. The Band suggests that perhaps he had reason for this as it prays “I’ve got plenty of nothing”.

Finally, the Band salutes another side of this Founding Father. The Band has formed Franklin’ legendary lightning rod and plays “I Get a Kick Out of You”.
