Ladies, Gentlemen, Friends, and Alumni, it’s that All New Razzmatazz <u>Damn</u> Co-Ed Band.

In the past twelve-month, Brown has changed more drastically than in any previous annum. Foremost, two and exotic wild flowers have recently spread their blooms amongst Brunonias aged grass. The Band salutes the new high-rise co-ed dorm with a bouquet of poppies in lieu of a pot of gold, and plays “Up, Up and Away.”

Many of these former Pembrokians have slipped into the infamous Wriston Quad, and have assumed permanent lodging. Coincidentally, Brown men have taken a distended interest in certain heavenly bodies, some have even entered into mail order extension courses and have mounted telescopes in their rooms to better determine the movements of the lofty celestial orbs. The Band focuses in on this new interest in astronomy and plays “Shine on Harvest Moon.”

What strange bed-fellows will be lured into Brown’s all new liberalized housing? Many brown men will conduct their own personal man on the street surveys solely to answer this question. And what new “tide” of dirt will Brown men pick up “dash”-ing down Thayer Street? The Band forms a sheet and to the rub-a-dub-dub Brown Knight of the linen service poses.

Also this year, we have shifted to the new Milton Noble Savings Time. All Brown men will rise a little later every day, since there are no more eight o’clock classes, we wish to give credit where credit is due as we play.

With all of these changes on the Brown scene we are confused, spent and distraught. Amidst our confusion we would like to reserve a brief moment to honor past president Ray L. Heffner and at the same time offer our choice for the new resident of 55 Power Street.

Damn that co-ed Band.
