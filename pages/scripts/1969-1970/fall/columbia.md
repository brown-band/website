Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you Colosseum lion lovers— presenting the Brown University Meandering Minsrels, and at the fore, Brown’s own minstrel cyclist.\

Faced with the querie, “What’s a Greek urn?”, the Band retorts, “$2.48 an hour.” on this note :sd[Band plays note] the Band presents its classical view of ancient history.

During the Trojan War, the Greeks, unable to get inside the walls of Troy, used a devious ruse to penetrate the Trojan fortress. When it was discovered that Greeks were effluing from the Trojan Horse, it was too late to stop the destruction of Troy. The Band forms that slippery steed on the field and plays “Entry Inside the Walls of Troy”

:sd[Band plays “Entry to the Colosseum” and proceeds to the next formation.]

The Band now wishes to salute Ulysses, who took one of the most famous trips in classical literature. Rehashing the story, Ulysses leaves the decks of his vessel to go tripping through the land of the lotus eaters. Dropping his placid demeanor, he speeds home to his heroine, Penelope. In recognition, the Band has formed his ship and plays “Won’t You Come Home, Ulysses?”

The Band now pays tribute to one of the biggest blunders in history. Everyone was familar with Pandora. One day, while contemplating her chest, she said, “I am curious” and lifted the lid, thereby unleashing the root of all evil. The Band has formed pandora's magic box and plays.

The Carthaginians were the odious underdogs in the extended Punic wars— a truly hairrising experience. The war stretched on for many years. At the close of the conflict, Hannibal searched for a pathway through the Alps in order to drive home his preponderous pachyderms. His attack was repelled in the final sweep, however, when his elephants were exhausted within the mammoth alpine crevices. In honor of the Carthaginians, the Band forms iwo of Italy’s finest peaks and plays “Climb Every Mountain”

And there it was, folks. The classical ending to a truly classical season. But _tempus fugit_, so keep cool cause we’ll see you on the ice December 2nd for Brown's first hockey game. And keep those cards and letters coming, Brown Band box 1145.
