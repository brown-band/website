## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, straight from their upset victories at Princeton and Cornell, it’s thai dauntless damn coed Band.

:sd[Band plays “Ever True” to goal line and then marches down field to cadence as is usual procedure]

:sd[while band is marching down field] At this time, the band wishes to thank alumni Paul Maddock for their new parkas.

:sd[March Into “H” and play “Harvardiania”. March across field and into “BRUIN” and play “Brown Cheering Song”]

:sd[After band has finished BBB] The Brown University Band now invites you to stand and join us in a moment of silence in memory of all those people who have died in the tragic Vietnam conflict. Would you please remain standing at its end.

:sd[Band plays fanfare to the Star Spangled Banner and holds drum roll while the following is said:]

Would you please join in the singing of our national anthem.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, direct from their most recent Rose Bowl appearance. Guess who? Nope, it’s just us bumbs again, the Brown University Marching Band, under the leadership of Andy Eisenberg.

:sd[Band plays Introduction to “Entry into the Coliseum” and begins to march down field at first strain]

And proudly presenting the pulsating, Pawtucket prancer — Dickie Knowles, leading, for the first time anywhere, the world’s largest — baritone sax section.

:sd[Band halts when front rank on far 30 yard line. On whistle, marches into first formation playing “Ever True to Brown” as segue]

Following in the hoof prints of Spiro Agnew, the Band wishes to trot around New York City, stopping first in Central Park, one finds the stable of equestrian society. Having ridden out the election successfully, cops may once again ride their mares. Saluting mounted patrolmen, who rub their horses down each night with Lindsay oil, the Band forms said steed and plays “The Horse.”

:sd[Band plays “The Horse” and then marches Into next formation on “Ever True” segue]

Astride its big white horse, the Band rides down into the land of the midnight cowboy — 42nd street. Saluting the seat of American culture, the band forms a marchi and, with the aid of Minsky’s hand-picked honeys, plays “Give My Regards to Broadway.”

:sd[Band plays “Give My Regards to Broadway” and then marches into next formation on “Ever True” segue]

Least, but not last, we take note of Mario, who couldn't quite bridge the 59th street gap from Queens to Manhattan. With tears in our eyes over his loss, the Band suggests he try further north — like the Aleutians. Since Mario lost his pizza die action, all of new york is feelin’ groovy.

Let’s hear it for the Brown University Band, and keep those cards and letters coming in support of them. Box 1145.
