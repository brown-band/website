For those who have experienced life in Little Rhody, the plight of the universal underdog is very real. Thus, on the eve of Columbus Day, the Brown Band would like to salute one of history’s outstanding underdogs, old Christopher himself. In 1492, Spain was a real drag, so Chris took a trip in search of the greener grasses of the orient. When he returned to Spain emptyhanded, Queen Isabella did a slow burn and was in no way turned on. In honor of Columbus and other trippers, the band forms a St. Christopher Medal and plays “Oh When the Saints Go Marching Out.”

Several centuries after Columbus, another underdog hit the fan — the American colonists. Having found their intercourse with the British too taxing, they decided to take matters into their own hands and make a surge for independence. Even then Bostonians enjoyed a good tea party, but now they have added the pot. The Band has formed said pot on the field and plays “Tea for Two.”

We now come upon the perennial underdog of the united states — the American Indian, who has found himself up that famous creek without a paddle innumerable times. As the white man plunged into more and more virgin territory, the indian fell prostrate before his spewing fire arms. Today after about a century of quiescent concentration, indians have finally decided to take no more of this “sitting bull” and even attempted to Sioux the United States government without reservation. In honor of this belatedly up and coming underdog, the Band forms a peace pipe and plays “William Tell Overture.”

Moving forward to our own times, the Band salutes one underdog who really made it — the New York Mets. While the Mets were striking out consistently and never getting to first base, Brown men could certainly identify with them due to their own comparable frustrations. However, this year’s Mets have not only eliminated their usual boners, but they have also stroked many a line drive through the hole, driving home the winning run. This underdog has learned how to score! The Band hopes that Brown men will continue to identify with them as we form a ball and bat and play some famous ball park organ music from the seventh inning stretch.

Last, but by no means least, the band views the Yale co-ed, a group that we feel are truly underdogs. Due to this influx, Yale has found it necessary to raise the entrance requirements for the male members of the community. For Yale men, a long dry spell has ended. The Band pregnantly awaits the fulfillment of Yale’s first co-ed year as we form this new breed of emancipated woman and play “Another Opening, Another Show.”

Let’s have a big hand for the Brown Co-Ed Band. And remember girls, cross your hearts.
