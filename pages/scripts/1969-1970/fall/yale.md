For those who have experienced life in Little Rhody, the forgotten plight of the universal underdog is very real. Thus, on the eve of Columbus Day, the Brown Band would like to salute one of history’s outstanding underdogs — old Christopher himself. In honor of Columbus and other trippers, the band forms a St. Christopher Medal and plays “Oh When the Saints Go Marching Out.”

We now turn to another low man on the totem pole — that perennial underdog of the United States — the American Indian, who has found himself up that famous creek without a paddle innumerable times. As the white man marched into more and more virgin territory, the Indian fell before his spewing fire arms. Today, after about a century of quiescent concentration, Indians have finally decided to take no more of this “Sitting Bull” and even attempted to Sioux the United States government without reservation. In honor of this belatedly up and coming underdog, the Band forms a peace pipe.

Moving forward to our own times, the Band salutes one underdog who really made it — the New York Mets. While the Mets were striking out consistently and never getting to first base, Brown men could certainly identify with them due to their own comparable frustrations. However, this underdog has learned how to score! The Band hopes that Brown men will continue to identify with them. We would like to toast the National League pennant winner with a bottle of champagne and some famous ball park organ music from the seventh inning stretch.

Mets, you’ve Braved Atlanta, but can you whip the Baltimore Birds.

Last, but by no means least, the band views the Yale co-ed, a group that we feel are truly underdogs. Due to this innovation Yale may found it necessary to raise the entrance requirements for the male members of the community. For Yale men a long dry spell has ended. The Band pregnantly awaits the fulfillment of Yale’s first co-ed year as we form this new breed of emancipated woman and play “Another Opening, Another Show.”

Let’s have a big hand for the Brown Co-Ed Band. And remember, next week at this same time don’t miss the Brown Band Golden Oldie Show. Featuring such memorable moments out of the past as the Brown University Precision Marching Unit, Steve Rost and His One Man Tour of New York City and many, many more.
