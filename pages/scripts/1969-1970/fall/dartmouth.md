Ladies, gentlemen, friends, Mr. Hanlon and alumni. Its that time of year again. As part of Brown’s unique homecoming festivities. The Band would like to present “golden oldies” — a melange of melancholy musical memorabilia, for those of you either old enough to remember or young enough to appreciate.

And now … here they are … the Brown University Precision Marching Machine. The year — 1967: Homecoming.

:sd[Roll off into “Washington Post”. The Band marches from the 20 to the opponents 30 and countermarches. The Band free lances at the 50 for 10 seconds, then forms XX. Above, one member marches on crutches.]

This show has been rated double X — its twice as bad as anything you will see at the movies … if you face the screen.

:sd[Band moves into concert oval of sorts.]

:sd[First Announcer] For those of you unfortunates unable to witness Steve Rost’s epic one man tour of New York City, here it is — the stellar performance that put the sun back in Fun City … the year — 1968. Paul Paton announcing.

:sd[Band plays “Feeling Groovy” softly.]

:sd[2nd Ann.] Would you please direct your attention to Mr.Rost in the center circle as he forms:

The Twin Trade Towers…\
Times Square…\
The Statue Of Liberty…\
The Staten Island Ferry…\
Staten Island…\
New Jersey…\
The Holland Tunnel…\
The Washington Bridges — George... And Martha

:sd[Band now moves into an ear.]

:sd[1st Ann.] From deep in the Corn Belt of the Empire State — the agronomy center of the Ivy League — the Brown Band presents the exposition that set Cornell on its ear. … the year — 1967 … the bands first aerial expedition into the unchartered wilderness.

:sd[2nd Ann.] Holy cow! The Brown Band has gone hog wild on this — its first trip to the Big Ten -er- Big Time city of Ithaca. We thought Cornell was fodder away and almost flew pasture airport, but we finally tractor down and grazed in to a peas-ful landing. When we arrived, we saw a herd of horse Cornell coeds sheepishly singing “Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines.” The Band had formed an ear of corn and plays some mood moo-sic.

:sd[Band plays “Magnificent Men.” Then moves into lightning rod.]

:sd[1st Ann.] From the birthplace of American Democracy, The Band would like to bring you its climaxing tribute to Philadelphia’s most productive citizen … the year — 1965… the place — Franklin Field in Philadelphia.

:sd[2nd Ann.] Benjamin Franklin was a man of many parts — humble humanist, bourgeois businessman, ingenius inventor and staminous statesman, a classic American, he devoted his life to his country and lived by the maxim — “early to bed and early to rise”. Even at age 80, he performed tirelessly as American ambassador in an attempt to analyse French affairs on a first hand basis. The Band salutes this many faceted man as we form our Founding Father’s famous lightning rod and play “The Beat Goes On.”

:sd[As band leaves the field]\
Let’s have a big hand for the sly, learing and sophomoric Brown Band.
