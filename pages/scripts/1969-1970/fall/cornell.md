Friends, farmers. and alumni, the Brown University Band regrets that it will be unable to be with you here this afternoon. After viewing the Big Red Precision Marching Machine on nationwide television, they decided they were unable to compete at the same level. In their place, here they are, the world renowned. internationaly acclaimed, Ithaca College Marching Band.

And introducing the strutting sensation of the Southern Tier, our own Trickie Dick, Knowles.

Having convinced you of our Big Ten authenticity, we now proceed to give you a fresh look at a Big Ten banality—a salute to America, as we view the odd couple, Nixon and Agnew. Obviously number one in any tribute is the Vietnam conflict—a situation from which the president is extricating us admirably as evidenced by his significant troop withdrawals :sd[Dickie leads members on, members off] and his national public address :sd[Dickie holds up sign] the nation has placed itself firmly behind the administration as witnessed by the October 15 moratorium. And so, starring the jazzy girls that set Paris on its flag waving rear, straight from the _folies bergere_, the Ithaca College Itchettes. The Band, having seen V-E day and V-J day, salutes Mr. Nixon’s attempt to reinstill national pride with his slogan, Victory in Defeat by forming V-D and playing “The President Richard Nixon March”

:sd[Band plays “President March”. Proceeds to final formation.]

Finally, this effete corps of impudent snobs would like to pay tribute to the mouth that roared. We suggest perhaps the cornell veternarians can handle his “virulent case of hoof-in-mouth disease”. Thus, with the help of the twin twirling dervishes of the Ithaca college band—that glorius, golden girl from jasper, wyoming—Roberta Silkes—and the twirling champ from Hornell. That's with an H, N.Y.—Carolyn Cropp. the band forms a zero for Spiro and plays “Classical Gas”.
