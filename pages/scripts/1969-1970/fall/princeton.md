Ladies and gentlemen, friends amd alumni, and all you classical cats—presenting the strongest argument yet for birth control, the Brown University Meandering Minstrels. Frank Marinaccio, director, Andy Eisinberg, head man, and Donald Herron, drum major.\
Faced with the query, “what's a Greek urn?”, the Band retorts, “$2.48 an hour.” On this note, :sd[Band plays one bass note] the Band presents its classical view of ancient history.

During the Trojan War, the Greeks, unable to get inside the walls of Troy, used a devious ruse to penetrate the Trojan fortress. When it was discovered that Greek sea men were effluing from the Trojan Horse it was too late to stop the destruction of Troy. The Band forms that slippery steed and plays “The Horse”.

The Band now wishes to salute Ulysses, who took one of the most famous trips in classical literature. Rehashing the story, Ulysses leaves the decks of his vessel to go tripping through the land of the lotus eaters. Dropping his placid demeanor, he speeds home to his heroine, Penelope. In recognition, the Band has formed his ship and plays “Up, Up, and Away.”

The Carthaginians were the odius underdogs in the extended Punic Wars — a truly hairrising experience. The war stretched on for many years. At the close of the conflict, Hannibal searched for a pathway through the Alps in order to drive home his preponderous pachyderms. His attack was repelled in the final sweep, however, when his elephants were exhausted within the mammoth alpine crevices. In honor of the Carthaginians, the Band forms two of Italy’s finest peaks and plays “Climb Every Mountain”.

Finally, the Band pays tribute to one of the biggest blunders in history. Everyone was familiar with Pandora. One day, while contemplating her chest, she said, “I am curious” and lifted the lid, thereby unleashing the root of all evil. The Band has formed Pandora’s magic box.

Let’s have a big hand, or even a little hand for the Brown University Strolling Troubadors.
