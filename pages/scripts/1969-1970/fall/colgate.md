Ladies, gentlemen, friends, and alumni, and all you freshmen mothers—and fathers, presenting the strongest argument yet for birth control—the Brown University Band appearing under the direction of Frank Marinaccio, the tactful administrative assistance of the phantom, Bill Schauffler, the lithesome grace of Don Herron, drum major, and the ebony stick of Rich Shapiro.

Scientists claim that no living organism can live in its own .waste. Man however, is trying. This progressively putrid problem that plagues our populace perplexes the powerful paternal principles of our paterland. In other words, pollution is a pain. In recognition of this fact, the band has made a “P” on the field as it dumps on pollution.

This century has witnessed the rise of American industry and good old Yankee know-how. However, the Band wishes to dispel the fallacy that technology is all good. Every day, factories cut loose countless tons of lethal gases into the air. The Band sniffs out the problem of air pollution as it stacks up on the field and plays “On a Clear Day You Can See Forever”.

We now turn to the members of the petroleum industry who with their slick techniques have managed to foul our beaches and beach our fowl. Starting oily in the morning and working well into the night, the gushers pump away We have also found that these culprits are morally way behind the times. The Band has formed a relic of this anachronistic industry, a gas tank, and plays “Classical Gas”.

Not even old Brunonia’s ivory towers have been left unsoiled; the ranks of the beer rebellion are often overflowing with polluted Brown men. Saterday will find Brown min full of Schlitz but nary a Gansett will cross their lips. What would old granddad have to say? The Band has formed a bloodshot eye, a common Sunday morning sight to most sadder Budweiser Brown men.

The ear-iest pollution of all is noise pollution. Firmly believing that one should give credit where credit is due, the Band graphically portrays the chief contributor to the noise problem in its final formation. the villian? The Brown University Marching Band.

Chalking up another win this week, after a tremendous overtime victory last week against Dartmouth, the Band remains first in the field undefeated and untied as yet in this year’s competition. We do, however, have yet to face our greatest adversary and, to support us in this coming battle, we need your pledges op support. All alumni. students, and friends of the band, who feel that the loss of the band's present identity would be a step backward on the evolutionary scale of halftime entertainment are asked to take just a minute and drop us a line voicing your approval. So if you would hate to see a cheap model of the U.R.I. band out here each week, please keep those cards and letters coming, folk.
