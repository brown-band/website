Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization that was recently voted best scramble band in America in the most recent Quinnipiac poll, it’s the Brown University “Blitz the Pitz? How ‘bout Mayhem in Meehan?!!” BAND!!!!!!!

Well, it certainly has been a long winter break. The band spent its month at home rather uneventfully, mostly playing their new Nintendo Wii and waiting to come back to campus. Many Brown students returned to campus, anxiously awaiting the addition of the new Friedman Study Center in the SciLi. The all night hours of this new facility will now allow some students the solution they have been waiting for to lose an undesirable roommate: between the shower in the CIT and the Friedman Center, students will never have to go to their rooms. Watch now as the band expresses the hours at which most of its members cram, I mean study, forms the SciLi and plays “Midnight Special.”

At the Grand Opening party for the center, the band was intrigued by the ambiguous decibel signs that hang in the new SciLi basement. We considered heading down there to display our version of 50 decibels. But instead we thought that the flutes would do a better job of going in there and demonstrating zero decibels, because most of us have lost the frequency they play on. Watch now as the band demonstrates this phenomenon while forming a zero and playing “You Can Call Me Al.” You seriously can’t hear the flutes!

But enough about renovations around campus; nothing gets the band as excited as a counterskate. No telling if “The Best Ice Skating Band in the Land” will successfully complete this extremely dangerous formation, and each time it is attempted is a completely different experience. Look over there- I think they are about to attempt one now! Watch as the band performs this mythical maneuver while playing “In the Fray.”

The band looks forward to the plethora of upcoming hockey and basketball games this break as much as John Kerry is looking forward to the upcoming Presidential elections. Oh, no, I’ve botched the joke, I’m so sorry, oh man I feel so bad- goodbye cruel public!
