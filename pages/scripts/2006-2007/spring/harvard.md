Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization that is still in awe of the Canadian Parliamentary system, it’s the Brown University “Power Street? I hardly know‘er street!” BAND!!!

<!-- not confident about the “bear.yea.” part — all the special characters were replaced with dots so I had to guess -->

The band always relishes the opportunity to meet the Crimson on the field of athletic competition. A color is always bound to put up a good fight against a bear.yea. Speaking of Larry Summers, the band was pleasantly surprised to read this past week that the new president of Harvard is going to be a woman by the name of Drew G. Faust. We applaud Harvard for this forward thinking decision. When nobody else was bold enough to appoint a woman president, the shining beacon of American higher education rose to the challenge and showed us that a woman can be the president of an Ivy League school. O wait, that wasn’t you guys, was it? At last count, didn’t Brown and Princeton both already have women presidents? Yea that’s right. Watch now as the band forms a female and explains how happy we are that Ruth is not going from us to them.

When Ruth was quoted expressing her lack of interest for the Harvard job, the band was elated. Just in case she was thinking about jumping ship, we made a list of reasons why Brown is a better school to be the president of:

:::script-list

- A. Cross registration at RISD- It was the number one factor in my decision to come here
- B. National media coverage on “The O.Reilly Factor.”
- C. Nothing at Harvard’s late night eateries can compare to the Chicken Carb.
- D. Strong programs for women in the sciences.
- E. Ruth, we love you so much, we know it’s a little late, but will you be our Valentine?
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!!

Showing true love for our president, the band will now form a heart and play “Gimme Some Lovin.”

For our final act tonight, the band will once again grace all of you fine people with our performance of the daring, dastardly, and, if I do say so myself, debonair, COUNTERSKATE! We.ve been practicing a lot since the last time we did this, but it is doubtful that there will be any noticeable change. Its ok though, we just changed the grade option on ice shows to S/NC. Watch now as the band enters No Work City and counterskates while playing “In the Fray.”

Thanks for coming out tonight, kiddies. This is our last ice show for the year, but look for us around campus this spring. And if you ever need us, you know who to call...the A Team!
