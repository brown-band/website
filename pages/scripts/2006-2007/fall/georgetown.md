## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s been on both sides of the benedict it’s the Brown University “Holy Water Batman” Band!!

:sd[Band runs onto field]

The Brown Band is so very excited that Georgetown has graced us with their presence that we are can barely stop our instruments from leaking. Last time we came to Georgetown, you guys blessed the field, and because at Brown we pride ourselves sharing the experience, we decided to do the same. But since we have no official religious affiliation watch now as the band ushers our very own spiritual figure onto the field and plays a hymn, wholely.

:sd[Band Forms Death Star, plays Imperial March]

Now that the field has been made palpatinely holy, the band will B-labor the point play in the pray.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni Presenting an Organization that always runs trots and skis! It’s the Brown University “why is there red in my Brown!?” Band!

So many changes have occurred at Brown this semester. They’ve added 69 cents to the meal price and have given us 5 more dollars to wrap our Paws around. With all this money flowing back to the students, the Brown Band has managed to buy out Brown and has now deemed campus as fully communist. So Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, welcome to RED university (Band takes off jackets). As our first order of business, the RED Band will celebrate this glorious occasion by making a tribute to Sean Connery, and going a Hunt for Red September.

:sd[Band form a Tribute and plays September.]

There are going to be some serious changes going on now that Red is the new Brown. Vice-President of Communism is Dean Mao Zedong. Dean of Women Advancement is Ms. Ho Chi Minh. And in charge of Campus Initiatives of Today is a guy named John, who told us he’ll present his set of initiatives tomorrow—\*cough\*—but until then that we should make a monument for our beloved President, Ruth the Red, and play “You Can Call Me Jake.”

Ruefully, due to a lack of work ethic and some indelible corruptness that comes from residing in Rhody, the Band has been forced to sell Red back to Brown. Although saddened by the loss of our grand nation, the artists-formerly-known as Red are always ready to Brown themselves again. Watch now as the Band waggles its instruments ebulliently at masses, forms a B, and welcomes Brown Forevermore.

:sd[band forms B and plays #3]

Join us Next week when Brown welcomes Harvard—with a vengeance!
