## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an Organization that’s been giving instruction in any area that counts since ’69, It’s the Brown University ...Hey! I What are you doing?!! I didn’t even say it yet!’ BAND!

The Brown Band has recently decided to write a children’s book, and has been frantically looking around for inspiration. And thanks to Cornell’s wonderful ability to inspire the child-like brain activity and your new President, we have a book. So with Seussian homage, here’s the title Brown Band latest’s work: President Skorton hears a Big Red What! To commemorate the debut of this book, the Brown Band will now form the cover art of the book and play Come on and READ!

Now here’s the story, Skorton the President, who one day on the fifteenth of May decided to throw his life away, became the Leader of group of capital A’s . Befuddled, Bejittered, and all Afittered after several days, he wondered, “O how can I correct my life of dismay.” Searching, and seeking for a way out, he finally found one without doubt. “I’ll go to Qatar, that’s pretty far, maybe hang out in some booty bar.” But once again his choice was wrong, for the Big Red What was there and strong. As Tears, tears rolled down his face, he sadly said, “I’ll never be free of this place.” Yeah its sad, we know—so watch now as the Brown Band forms a B for Buck up and plays the “Brown cheering you up” song. \* Sniffle \*

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an Organization that puts the “homey” back in Homecoming, it’s the Brown University “Duck Duck Goose Goose Goose JaigerM:sd[hurling sound]. Band

Mommy and Daddy are here, and the Brown Band couldn’t be more excited. They gave us life, supported us when we needed it the most... provided us with that perfect—or not so perfect image for us to model ourselves after. The thought that we will one day turn into you is…comforting…yeah—that’s the word. So watch now as the Brown Band forms a symbolic comforter and plays … Kinship.

We gotta say, parents, one of the best things you ever did was send us to Brown. So we polled you guys to find out why did, and here are the results:

:::script-list

- A) You didn’t want to go here
- B) You thought it was a Historically Black institution
- C) You were under the influence when you made the decision
- D) Because of the wonderful advertisement on Bill O’Reilly
- E) Its not Gorgeous
- F) The Princeton Band!

We hope you all enjoyed the Red Brown Show.its not the Red Green one, but it’s 50% less Canadian! We’d love to stick around a little longer, but we have to go raise our endowment. Just kidding..but seriously, there will be a donation bucket at the Brown University Band section of the of the bleachers. Watch now as the Brown Band shamelessly solicits its alumni for more money, forms a B, and plays “Brown Burr-sar.”
