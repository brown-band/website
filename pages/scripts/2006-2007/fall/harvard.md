## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that will never stop coming early, It’s the Brown University “Roshashanna, Roshashanna, Oy Vey Vey, Lech Heim!” Band!

The Brown Band was so happy to hear that Harvard was saving the bacon of poorer students everywhere by ending early admission. Your actions and initiatives in the matter have even given Princeton the impetus to address its own early admission predicament. That takes chutzpah, and we admire that. By removing the silver spoon of privilege from the bowels of sordid legacy, you have taken the measures required to stick it to the man, or woman. To commemorate this glorious day, the Brown Band will form a symbolic spoon and play Hold On ’Til Spring, I’m Coming.

Although we applaud you Harvard for you coming to sensibilities and trying to do the right thing, but realistically you guys have just given prospective high school seniors, one more reason to Brown themselves. So watch now as we represent those high school seniors, make a symbolic B-line to the Van Wickle gates, and proclaim our status as Brown Men Born.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an Organization that not Ruthless, it’s the Brown University “Ruth gets to stay, You get a Chinese vegetable!” Band!

The Brown Band is concerned about the state of the world at the moment. Up is down, left is right, black is white. Pluto isn’t a planet. We feel cheated and lied to. In fact, we realize that this removal our beloved Pluto as a planet is only one example of a plethora of facts turned false. Segways were supposed to be the end of walking, but we still have to use our legs like chumps. Fresh Spinach was supposed to be good for you, now it’s bringer of violent dysentery. The Boogie Man was supposed to be false, but now we find out he’s currently making Jamaican dance hall records. Watch now as the Brown Band mentally grasps these revelations, forms a specter it hardly knows, and proves it’s not afraid of the boogie man or any ghosts.

The Brown Band has just compiled a list of things once true, but are now defunct just to prove to how full of lies this world is. And here’s the list:

:::script-list

- A) The Link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda…Unless it’s an unannounced Legend of Zelda video game title.
- B) That Ronald Reagan tore down the Berlin Wall—we found out wrecking balls were used.
- C) Social Security. If you aren’t getting it now, you won’t ever.
- D) That The Cookie Monster eats cookies. C is NOT For cookies but for carrots, and that is NOT good enough for me.
- E) The Brontosaurus. How can something go extinct twice? Apatosaurus on the head for whoever was in charge of that one.
- F) THE PRINCETON BAND!!!

:::

Well—the last one isn’t defunct, and hopefully it never will be (semper fi Stanford Band), but Watch now as the band forms a time machine, and goes back in time to pay tribute to when all these things were true …or not.

As we finally come to terms with all this, we can’t help but realize some things never change...like Harvard’s sub-parness. Wait, what this? Apparently a group of scientists have gotten together and decide Harvard is now a dwarf university because it is too cold and distant. Tough luck for the Crimson, but its ok… you’ll still always the Michigan of the East. Watch now as the band forms a B cough for Harvard’s new flushometers and plays #2.

Join us next week when Bruno battles the Ram and shouts “It’s either U! R I!”
