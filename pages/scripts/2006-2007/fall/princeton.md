## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization can’t wait for the premiere of Doom 2: I still know what you doomed last summer, it’s the Brown University “the Bone Saw is Ready!” Band!

:sd[Band runs onto field]

Last time the Princeton Band Jabroni’s came to Brown town, the felt the wrath of the people’s trombone as one of our Brown Band Fathers tackled that cocky Princeton drum Major. Now that were in your wrestling arena we want to challenge you to another game…OF PAIN! O YEAH! So if you jabroni’s think you can handle the Macho Band of Brown University, COME GET SOME! OOO YEAH! Watch as the Band forms wrestling ring and asks DO YOU SMELLLLLLLLLLLLL What Bruno is cookin’?

:sd[Band forms circle and plays Smells like teen spirit]

We’re gonna break you in half! We are gonna throw your own pimps at ya! But most importantly we are gonna form a B, and say “We’ll be waiting for YOU In the FRAY!”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization that doesn’t need grade inflation because it really is just getting smarter, it’s the Brown University “000010011011011101110111101100101…2” Band!

The Brown Band has got your number Princeton. The signs of your insecurity are so obvious. Your blatant correction of your early admission problem right after Harvard’s…the inflation of your ehem Egos by denying grade inflation…the investment in a super computing instrument with an enormous hard drive. So to recognize this swelling insecurity, watch as the band forms two binoculars to represent our ever-vigilant eyes, and hopes you to stop Horsin’ around and be true to yourselves.

:sd[Band forms 2 circles and plays The horse]

As for that supercomputer, the Brown Band was thinking of all the things you can’t do to get more ram for your buck—here’s the list:

:::script-list

- A) KK Keep Minorities out of Princeton. There’s a Black guy oo look another one!
- B) Make New Jersey a more desirable place to live—I mean come on.
- C) Protect Princeton Drum Majors from beatings from Brown Dads—YOU’RE MINE!
- D) Make those ridiculous orange jackets look good.
- E) Calculate GPAs lower than a 4.0
- F) THE PRINCETON BAND

:::

To represent this list in RISDEIC fashion, watch as the Brown Band forms a Super-Computer and lets everyone what you’ll really be using the computer for.

Well now we’re coming to the end of stint on the field we have to make sure we play with the Woody Woo and admire the physical manifestation of your ”Scili envy.” e.g. your “Math-Li.” Oh by the way, we noticed the latin motto of school is Dei sub numine viget. We only have this to say: Dei sub numine tamen exsorbet. While we leave to suck on this, watch as the band chills out, forms a B, and plays Bring the Whiskey!

:sd[Band form B and plays Bring the Victory]

Join us Next week when the Brown Band welcomes Cornell and thanks their parents for putting in the extra dough to keep them from engorging themselves.
