## Pregame

Ladies and Gentleman, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an Organization that has a history with Chaffey, Lincoln, is the Brown University “Hurras today, gone tomorrow?” Band!

The Brown Band is exhausted from its 69-minute pilgrimage across the expansive state of Rhode Island, but is all a jitter to see the supple Cup of the Governor. If you play your game right, URI, this year could be your chance to get lucky, as we all know URI hasn.t Rammed its way to a scoring and winning season since 2001. Now this might be because of your cough conservative endowment or it could be because URI sounds like UTI... But in any case, we love you rhody—lose or lose, rain or…rain. So watch now as we represent our love for you, form a heart and play From Me to U.RI.

Now that we’ve shared our feelings and everything is out in the open we are going take a break. Watch as the Brown Band trombone section shines its rusty instruments for the game while the band forms a B for Bumming around, and plays “Brown? There!”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni Presenting an Organization that needs a Kleenex every time, it’s the Brown University “Keep it Gesund-tight!” Band!

The Brown Band noticed that URI was holding Speak-Easy Jeopardy today from 2-6pm, and being the helpful and sincere organization that we are, decided to help facilitate the matter. But before we do, let us just say we very proud of U..RI for taking measures to lubricate its obviously desiccated campus. With less friction, we are sure coming and goings of campus will be going much Smoother . To represent this, watch now as the Band forms a symbolic greased wheel and plays Smooth.

Ok now Back to Speak-Easy Jeopardy. The Band has been busy thinking of categories to wet the whistles of those participating. And here they are:

:::script-list

- A) Members of the Penn Fifteen club—for 420
- B) Vulcanized Fruits—for 6900
- C) Sticky situations at the URI Oozeball—for 21
- D) Genetically Engineered Hypoallergenic Pussycats—dander I hardly know her!
- E) The Double E—EEEEEEEEEE
- F) THE PRINCETON BAND

We hope with these ideas that you could go all the way, and that your game will be much more pleasant for all those involved. To aid in the festivities, the Brown Band will now make ice cream just the way your mother likes it, play Stacey’s Mom’s Ice cream.

Well its time to us to go Rhody, no no It’s not you, its URI. Be strong guys as you are a mighty institution. In fact, some may even call you the Harvard of nowhere. So as we bow out, The band will grab some Craisins from “The Butt” Refectory, form a B for Benevolence, and play Thanks 4 sharing.

Next week the Bruno will face Holy Cross, and although the band won’t physically be there, our spirit will surely cross the line.
