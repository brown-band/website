## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that can no longer turn away from the horror of its own mortality — the realization that it is older than it has ever been and, crushingly, the youngest it will ever be again, it’s the Brown University “But at least we still have our good friend Joe.” :sd[Band: “Joe Mama!”] BAAAAAAAANNNNNNNDDDDDD

:sd[Instead of zippering normally, the band jamammi’s onto the field in two lines. We will all be facing forward in a jamammi conga line. Instead of “jamammi”, we say “joe mama”.]

:sd[Line up on the left 45 yard line facing the 50.]

“The [fitness gram Pacer test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82jDHRrswc) is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter Pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal :sd[bloOop]. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound :sd[ding]. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.”\
:sd[We run the pacer test to the right 45 yard line for 3 dings, people drop out during this and get situated on the line. When finished, we all line up on the front side line for the full length of the field behind the command center so we can’t see Malachi and play Ding Dong Song on kazoos.]

If that mess didn’t convince you that we are a professional ivy league marching band, here are some things we’ve done that will.

:::script-list

- A. Crossed Holy Cross
- B. Yaled holy yale
- C. Booped a poor lady in the face with a bagel
- D. Borrowed traffic cones from three Ivy League institutions
- E. Mowed the Harvard Yard, and
- F. The Princeton Band

:::

watch now as the band asserts that sharing is caring and plays I Want Your Cone

:sd[The band forms a circle and rotates clockwise and plays Joshua]

:sd[make your best Chicago tornado siren impression for as long as you feel is appropriate] Number Nine. Number Nine. Number Nine. :sd[make your favorite bird noise] :sd[Pick a random consonant, vowel, and two more consonants. Make this noise a few times] :sd[Pick your favorite non-offensive word and beep it in Morse Code] :sd[Make your favorite 3 beeping noises] Attention: Will the owner of the blue 2004 Jeep Liberty please come up to the box to atone for your sins. :sd[:break[waowaowaowaowaowaowaowaowaowaowaowaowao]].\
シンジ、エヴァに乗れ。(Shinji, eba ni nore)\
And now the Band will play :sd[play glitchy screeching noise into mic]

:sd[the band plays FAVORITE SONG and makes FAVORITE FORM]

Catch us at halftime when we stick a hard candy into our Dart Orifice and recall our favorite memories of our senior class.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has plenty of engineers but a dearth of humanities concentrators, it’s the Brown University “you can drive a train, but can you write a poem?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hi, Dartmouth! Welcome to our time-honored tradition of ignoring you and focusing on ourselves! I'm sure you have a college worthy of being mocked, but instead we'll be discussing our seniors. They’ve worked so hard at making our band the best one in the Ivy League, and in this stadium right now, so we figured the least we could do was spit some incredible lines in their honor.

From the Final Frontier of Washington\
Comes our favorite first-year senior Adam Furman.\
A STEM Man to the core\
Physics, math, cs, and more,\
A pleasure having him on the bass drum it’s been.\

From Nebraska, Amber is rural,\
Call her Ambers, now she’s plural,\
Wrote all our scripts,\
As The Walrus, she is equipped,\
To make the Beatles a mural.

We know Ánh for her red beret\
And the section snacks she brings each day\
She plays such a good horn\
And once boiled us Corn, \
But alas she forgot it, oy vey!

Dorrie hails from the great state of Maine\
No meat here, she only eats grains\
Has a hamster named Mochi\
Concentrates in Chem-E\
We’re in awe of her incredible brain

Mentor in the Bee Dee Double You\
I’d ask to use the 3D printer but I don’t want to trouble you\
Cymbal player from Texas\
Deserves to drive a Lexus\
Frances, dearest, we don’t deserve you.

It's time for us to talk about Charlie.\
It's true that we've never seen him in a Harley.\
The freshmen he scares\
With his peculiar glares\
Thanks for safewalking us down a dark alley.

Haisong’s a great guy you will see,\
He never skips class BME.\
When he spikes with his left\
Your heart will be effed.\
So good luck on Southwestern UT!

From Rhode Island hails Hannah Joyce\
Whose music taste is truly Choice\
Says wicked and means it\
That bass drum, she beats it\
When I see her I want to rejoice.

There once was a lad from Dart-mouth\
Not New Hampshire, but to the far south\
He pulled out his foil,\
My pants I did soil,\
Do that again and I’ll kiss you right on the mouth

Jason parades around in free merch\
Stuff from Google, Jane Street, and research\
Gosh is it too late,\
Maybe CS really is that great\
Let the robots be our church

If you’re looking for a true triple threat\
Then Joie Mills is certainly your bet\
She can cartwheel, act, and sing\
Like it ain’t no big thing\
And she’s the sweetest flute player I’ve met

There once was a Julia Henke,\
From the Midwest, but she’s not a Yankee,\
She’s a big fan of nutella\
And she don't have Rubella\
But her leg do be mad stanky.

To NPR Lee Ding does listen\
The snow in Newfoundland does glisten\
Chicken prioritizer,\
Mathematics apply-icizor\
You’re okay but your advisor’s a Vision

:sd[read Nevada as nuh-vay-duh] This man often pops his knuckles,\
His one-liners will make you chuckle.\
From the town of Nevada,\
He knows about tornadas,\
It’s smiley Malachi Hornbuckle.

Building things that don’t go on land\
Is our clarinet friend Oliver Sand\
Juggling engineering and colorful balls\
And biking down Barus and Holls\
Build us a plane we demand!

Ryan Burnett’s a real great drummer\
Without him next year, we'll sound dumber\
He’s on our b'ryan't button\
In the cargos he’s struttin’\
Hey, cutie, can I get your number?

Miss Caskey is rec secretary\
If possible, Sara i’d marry\
3rd trumpet she tweets\
Her emails are sweet\
Inflatable John she'll always carry

Our most favoritest president Stacey\
During board meetings, she’s the opposite of spacey\
Audiobooks at slow speeds\
Differential equations she reads\
She’s-one-of-a-kind, no way to replace-y

Dressed sharply in a flannel, and timbs too\
Will Brakewood is often quite a view\
This semester he is now clad\
With a baby carrier, as Dorle’s new dad\
And to that we say, good 4 u.

William’s our Alumni Association link\
Brings his section the best food and drink\
He hails from Rhody\
Wants a BEO degree\
Just don’t end up in finance wink wink

Congratulations to the Class of 2022 on your impending exit from this immortal institution! Hope you enjoyed that stunning display of the underclassmen's poetic power—we’re tooootally going to be fine without you next year, yep, uh huh, yes we are. Bye for now—we’ll see you again when you’re crustier than those bagels we left behind at Penn (or just at the end of halftime). Brown band out!
