## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that would like to offer the founder of Microsoft a flirty-yet-fun sweater, it’s the Brown University “Cold Gates No More” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

:sd[robocall voice] Hello. You’ve reached the offices of Brown & Band, DDS. Please press 1 to schedule a dental exam. Press 2 to schedule an exam on your dental. Press 3 to examine a dental schedule. Press 4 to dental your exam schedule. Press 5 for :sd[schlurp noise]. Say ‘representative’ to speak to a representative. I’m sorry, I couldn’t understand you. Please try again. I’m sorry, I couldn’t understand you. Please try again. I’m sorry, I couldn’t understand you. You clearly need more help than our system can provide. Please hang up and watch now as the band plays We’ll Call You Back.

:sd[Band forms a phone and plays I Want You Back.]

We were in a hurry to get our dental degrees before a disgruntled customer reported us to the tooth fairy, but it turns out Colgate’s dental program was only an April Fool’s joke. We should have known by the fact that it only took one day and did not involve teeth. Besides, Colgate opening up a dental school makes about as much sense as Brown starting a colonoscopy program. Watch now as the band gloves up and plays Hey Man Bend Over.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Brown Man Born.]

Catch us at halftime, by which point you’ll have forgotten all about our brush with dentistry.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that by the end of the night will be thoroughly defeated, tied, and scored upon, but was at least invited, it’s the Brown University “I’m not talking about football” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey Colgate, remember us? About 200 years ago, our guy, Nicholas Brown, gave 1,000 smackeroos to you so that you could build West Hall (which we have gathered is a pretty important building on your frustratingly gorgeous campus). Anyways, it’s been a while and we have come to recoup our investment. After all, we’re in much need of new buildings ourselves. Taking into account inflation and interest, you owe us ONE MILLION DOLLARS! Or, like, 27K. Whatever. Past a certain point all numbers become meaningless and are nothing more than abstract concepts. Unless of course you’re collecting. Watch now as the band snaps back to reality and plays Owe It Still.

:sd[Band forms a dollar sign and plays Feel it Still.]

We were just checking the official list of most beautiful campuses in America—you know, a normal pastime—and we noticed that Colgate was placed right at the top. We’re not sure about that—here’s just a few places in the continental US we think have Colgate beat in terms of beauty.

:::script-list

- A. The world’s largest ball of twine
- B. The slimy milk puddle that always forms beneath dumpsters
- C. The SciLi
- D. Hamilton College in Hamilton, NY (right?)
- E. The Bass Pro Shop Pyramid and
- F. The Princeton band

Set up your lawn chair, crack open a cold one with the rats, take in the pyramidal glory of the world’s strangest monument to capitalism, and watch now as the band plays Raise your Solo Cup.

:sd[Band forms the Colgate campus (which is rather phallic if you look at it right) and plays Raise Your Glass.]

Besides, we all know beauty is more than skin deep. And appearances won’t matter—after all, everybody dies. If you’re lucky you can spend eternity in the Colgate Body Repository, A Very Normal Thing To Have On Campus That Is Not At All Weird or Unusual. The ghosts of James B Colgate and James C Colgate have assured us it’s perfectly comfortable there—huh, I guess James A Colgate didn’t make the cut. At least he is not forever cursed to direct people to the other James Colgateses buildings! Beg the unhearing void of death for mercy, realize nothing is certain except your own end, resign yourself to the anonymous fate of James A Colgate, and watch now as the band conveniently glosses over the Annmary Brown Memorial while playing Brown Surviving Song.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Brown Cheering Song.]

All good things must come to an end, including this performance. Brown Band Out!
