## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just friended your dad on Facebook, it’s the Brown University “We understand if you don’t feel comfortable calling us Mom yet” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey Princeton! It’s family weekend! We’re so excited to welcome everyone’s families and get to know you all. And what better way to do that than some light social media stalking? Now, we were on Facebook the other day and—look, we don’t know how to tell you this, but your parents are kind of, um… wow, this is totally embarrassing to say, but they were telling other parents that you were riding Greyhound buses. Like, they just said that in public where God and Wall Street and everybody can see. We just thought we ought to let you know that future employers may be aware that you were on public transport, rubbing elbows and knees with the proletariat. Spring for a photoshoot in a fake jet to salvage your reputations and watch now as the band chats up over-involved parents in Princeton group chats while playing Hooked on your Facebook.

We were just checking the weather to figure out if we had to bring our raincoats. Here at Brown, we typically use a weather forecasting app. But we heard that over at Princeton, you need a Nobel Prize to be the weatherman! Do you have something wrong with your clouds? Or is that thing where it rains raw meat every third Tuesday normal in New Jersey? Break out your reinforced steel umbrella, try not to breathe too deeply, reap the consequences of living in Jersey, and watch now as the band takes meteorology S/NC while playing In the Rain.

Catch us at halftime when we Venture Forward to put our values into action and move from the present to the possible by begging for your money!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that definitely didn’t rifle through your archives in the Prince, it’s the Brown University “It’s Not Cyberstalking I Just Regularly Read Newspapers From 1958 About Your School Specifically” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We congratulate you on your enjoyment of Big Football, the only sport guaranteed to distract you from the allure of Communism—at least according to an article in the Daily Princetonian. Admittedly the article was mad old, but the more things change, the more they stay exactly the same. Diversify your portfolio, rack up a massive charge on your dad’s credit card in the name of national security, and watch now as the band does Not eat the rich and plays Capitalist Band.

:sd[Band forms Jeff Bezos’s Rocket and plays the first sixteen measures of Cantina Band over and over until Malachi [our head conductor] has had enough.]

Now that we’ve established officially that east-coast colleges are in no way hotbeds of progressivism, watch us…
