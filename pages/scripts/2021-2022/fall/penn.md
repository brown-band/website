## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that needs to borrow a writing utensil but can only speak in sentences two syllables long, it’s the Brown University “You pen. Me have?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hello, Penn, and welcome to the spookiest time of year—freshman plague season. We heard you’re having a little trouble keeping up with COVID testing, if those pulsing red Penn Open Passes are anything to go by. Watch now as the band participates in dodecaweekly testing—or was that heptadecal? and plays I Test Myself.

:sd[Band forms [spooky] and plays I Touch Myself.]

We have a Penn. We have an Apple. We have a campus-wide health crisis. We have a Pen Pineapple Apple Penn Open Pass. We have taken care of the campus-wide health crisis. Now it’s over, so we have a Pen Pineapple Apple Penn Open Pass Past. I’m at the Penn wrestling tournament, and people are using some crazy moves—I think that’s a Pen Pineapple Apple Grapple Penn Open Pass Past! The stadium was closed, though, so the competition is taking place in a small church. Grab a drink and come to the Pen Pineapple Apple Grapple in a Chapel Penn Open Pass Past Snapple Mass!

Watch now as the band limbers up its last-ditch latent lingual lexicon and plays Raise Your Pen Pineapple Apple Grapple Chapel Penn Open Pass Past Mass Snapple Glass.

:sd[Band forms an apple chapel and plays Raise your Glass.]

Catch us at halftime when beetles fight these battles in a bottle with their paddles.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is taking its motto-writing class S/NC, it’s the Brown University “Lorem Ipsum Ki Bear Come Now” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey Penn, did you know you had an issue with your original motto? We totally get it—Latin can be tricky. The Brown Band was certainly surprised when it learned that our motto “_Miximus in lecto_” didn’t actually translate to making delectable mixed drinks during class. Still, though, at least we never discovered that our 100-year-old motto could be translated as “loose women without morals.” But, uh, yeah, Penn, in 1898, you did. It’s really too bad: “sine moribus vanae” had such a nice ring to it.

Watch now as the band heads to the Zicklin Center for a lecto [sic] in Legal Studies and Business Ethics, solves the trolley problem, and plays “Our hips can neither confirm nor deny these allegations of tax fraud.”

:sd[Band forms the trolley problem and plays Hips Don’t Lie.]

After talking to a Penn alum who never actually told us which Penn they graduated from—Penn state? Penn Cambria High School? Pen by Bic?—and whatever other lesser Penns may or may not exist—we’ve decided to de-commit from Brown while we consider our options. Here are several reasons You, Penn, might be superior:

:::script-list

- A. you’re #2 in billionaires, and #1 in embarrassing alumni :sd[pause to allow listeners to fill in the blank with Donald J. Trump] right alumni? Isn’t this embarrassing?
- B. 50% off brazilian waxes, only ten itchy steps away from campus!
- C. We’ve always dreamed of living on the set of the critically-acclaimed film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
- D. You’re the Alma mater of the creator of Law and Order, which means you have educated between one and many Dick Wolves.
- E. Your notorious sex fiend of a founder Ben Franklin was much hotter than the Brown brothers and
- F. The Princeton band

:::

After careful consideration, we’ve decided to take it all back and renew our vows to good ol’ Brown. We honestly prefer eating rats at the Ratty, so watch now as the band grabs some gravy, a knife and spork, and a set of glue traps and cooks up some Rat Poutine.

:sd[Band forms a rat and plays Rasputin.]

BREAKING: Jimmy Carter did NOT attend Penn, no matter what you may have heard. We repeat: Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, ABSOLUTELY did NOT ATTEND PENN UNIVERSITY, but George William Crump, congressman, onetime medical student, and the world’s first recorded streaker ABSOLUTELY did. He was later appointed by President Andrew Jackson as chief clerk of the Pennsion Bureau in 1832. Now there’s a legacy to be proud of.

Take off your clothes, put on a set of scrubs, roll up to the White House and watch now as the band plays slash-R-slash-brownbares.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Brown Bear.]

Wait, isn’t tomorrow Halloween? Brown Band Out.
