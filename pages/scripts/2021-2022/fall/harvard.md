## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that denies any involvement in the recent spate of bicycle punching incidents, it’s the Brown University “U-Lock, U-Duck, U-Cover” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Don’t worry, Harvard! The Brown Band has heard about your recent slew of Bicycle Punching Incidents (trademark pending) and we’re donning our investigation skinsuits as we speak! We’re shifting our ten-speed coffee machine into the most middling intensity gear possible—get ready for some moderately engaged evidence pedalling, and look for your story near the bottom of the 24-hour news cycle.\
Strap on some protection in the form of a bike helmet (you gotta fight tire with tire) and watch now as the band mounts our communal bike, puts on our boxing gloves, and plays Everytime We Punch—yeah, it’s a little on the nose, but, so were the punches.

:sd[Band forms a fixt and plays Everytime We Touch.]

Alright, the results of our investigation are in, and we’ve positively identified the Harvard University Pedaling Puncher (a second trademark pending) as the reanimated corpse of John Harvard, back from the dead to exact his revenge for three hundred and eighty three years of Harvard students doing freaky foot stuff and golden showers with his statue. Y’all weird.\
Keep it in your pants, no, seriously, come on, guys, that’s like, legit kinda weird, you get how that’s weird, right? It’s like, super weird—and watch now as the band kink-shames, kink-keeps, kink-bosses and plays Pompee.

:sd[Band forms John Harvard and plays Pompeii.]

Catch us at halftime when the band misses its exit and ends up in the great state of confusion.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that forgot to file its WD-40s, it’s the Brown University “Lubricating, Penetrating, and Moisture Displacing” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Ah, Hartford, the insurance capital of the world! Whether you’re here for business or pleasure, there’s always— hang on a second— \*paper shuffling\* Sorry for the mixup, folks, I’ve just been informed that this is not our gig for the Connecticut Office of Tourism (that’s next week), but our halftime show for the game against… Haaaaiiiirrrvvvvaaaaaaarrrrd? Heeeereeeeverd? Whatever that is.\
Watch now as the Band finally does its readings, has a stern yet compassionate discussion about performance expectations with its travel coordinator, rotates its map half a pi to the left, and plays Stacy’s Mom Has Been Placed Under Performance Review.

:sd[Band forms Connecticut and plays Stacy’s Mom.]

Sorry about that. We’ve just received the correct informational report about “Hoarvard,” a community college in Amherst. Here’s a few other things we learned about you all during our DIY virtual tour and info session:

:::script-list

- A. Your alumni parents don’t wash their kids
- B. Your fencing coach accepted 1.5 million in bribes—en garde!
- C. No Spring Break, just (un)wellness days
- D. Egg is the 37 of words
- E. Your list of esteemed alumni includes John Connolly, the famed mobster
- F. The Princeton band

:::

Overall, we think you’ve got a nice university there and :sd[Italiano accent] it would be a shame if something were to happen to it. Watch now as the band offers you an insurance policy you can’t refuse and plays Collegiate Mobster.

:sd[Band forms a fedora and plays Rock Lobster.]

Mom, come pick me up, I took a wrong turn and ended up in the Harvard LinkedIn Network. I’m scared. Everybody here talks like Patrick Bateman with worse taste in music. People keep jumping out at me and asking if I’d like to join their consulting firm. I think I saw Mark Zuckerberg eating a raw wildebeest haunch.\
Clean the blood off your silver spoons and watch now as the band makes new connections, dodges iffy internship offers, accepts a prestigious clerkship at Burger King, and plays Brown Networking Song.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays #2]

It’s been really exciting to play with such a well-endowed group of people! Brown band out.
