## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that would like to refer you to our previous correspondence, if only we had any, it’s the Brown University “We’re begging you to answer your Stupid EYale” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hello? Hello? Yale, are you there? It’s me, God. I’m here to refer a message from the Brown University Band since the letters, carrier pigeons, and cross-state screaming they’ve directed your way have all gone unanswered. The message is this: Five letters good, four letters bad. Watch now as the band calls off its drone-delivered message and plays “Every Time We Get in Touch.”

:sd[Band forms a pigeon and plays Everytime We Touch.]

Hi, Yale. Are you there? It’s me, Satan. I’m here to tell you that it’s actually totally fine if you don’t want to answer any of our emails in a timely fashion. Violate the Ivy Band agreement. You know you want to. In fact, I know emails aren’t your strong suit—apparently an email issue is how Yale’s newest club, The Council of Davids, was formed. If we change our name to the David University Band, can we join? Now if only there was a council to run your band. Watch now as the band scrambles to plan for two and plays For Us and for You.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays For Bruno and For Brown.]

Catch us at halftime when we navigate logistical issues like we’ve been doing it for almost a century, because, oh wait, we have—right, alumni?

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is pleased to welcome its alumni back to campus with the utmost regard, honor, and respect, it’s the Brown University “yo what’s up, moldy oldies” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We are contractually required to cover all outbreaks of humorous assaults on Ivy League campuses, so today we will fulfill our obligation to you — our listenership — by discussing your recent spate of paintball incidents. According to the excellent reporting in the Yale Daily News, it’s becoming something of a tradition. Of course, as a band, we stand firmly against all forms of assault, and we also stand against unreasonable searches of our dark-colored sedan for paintball paraphernalia. Watch now as the band throws out some paint-covered smocks and plays “Paintball.”

:sd[Band forms a sedan and plays “Pompeii”]

We’re honoring Brown University alumni this week, so we figured it would be nice to honor some of our favorite alumni of Yale, like:

:::script-list

- A. Nick Carraway
- B. The American Psycho
- C. Statistically probably several other American psychos
- D. Mr. Moby Dick himself
- E. Yerry, who’s looking for a yob, and
- F. The Princeton band

:::

Call me Ishmael and I’ll call you by the name Montero, put down that peach, and watch now as the band plays The Ishmael That I Get.

:sd[Band forms a peach and plays The Impression That I Get.]

Speaking of ice, it will soon be winter! And the coming of winter means that the world’s only ice-skating marching band (yours truly) will be joining the ranks of our school’s Skate-America competitor in winning gold over Yale, something that is greatly helped by the fact that our band actually skates and your band definitely does not.\
And that ends our paragraph. **T**ighten your **L**aces, and and **L**ighten your **T**aces, and watch now as the band sharpens up its skates to play Ice Blade in Ice Skate Fray Ice (In the Fray).

:sd[Band forms a B and plays In the Fray]

Haha old. Brown Band Out.
