::script-note[Columbia wouldn’t let us play in their stadium. Context for this script: on Sunday, 11/07/21, there was both [a bomb threat on Brown’s campus](https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2021/11/brown-evacuates-students-due-to-bomb-threat), and [a deer trapped in the entrance to Morriss Lounge](https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2021/11/deer-entered-morris-hall). -AF+JF]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has had an explosively tense week, it’s the Brown University “is that a suspicious package in your pocket or are you just coming down from the adrenaline rush of having your dorm evacuated” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

LET’S GO WOMEN’S SOCCER! WOOOOOO I LOVE IT WHEN WE WIN!! I SURE HOPE WATCHING A BROWN UNIVERSITY SPORTS TEAM THAT IS UNDEFEATED IN THE LEAGUE DOESN’T AWAKEN ANYTHING IN ME, LIKE AN INSATIABLE DESIRE TO WIIIIIIIIIIN! OH—oh wait, hang on, I’m getting a phone call… Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay.

Ahem. Oh deer, oh deer, it seems we have an unauthorized visitor in our dorm building. He walks like a confused and frightened four-legged Cervidae, but he talks… also like that. Watch now as the band holds the door for our new furry friend, calls up the environmental police, and plays Accidentally in MoChamp.

:sd[Band forms a deer and plays Accidentally in Love.]

We heard that St. Johnald may not give a formal GPA, :sd[Band yells NOR DO THEY ACTUALLY TEACH ANYTHING!] but we don’t really have a leg to stand on there. Still, at least our majors actually make sense, unlike St Johnjamin’s degrees in:

:::script-list

- A. Hospitality management :sd[band yells ROOM SERVICE!]
- B. Homeland security :sd[band yells SHOES OFF!]
- C. Student Government, comma, Incorporated :sd[band yells BIG BROTHER WHAT ARE YOU DOING?]
- D. Decapitation? :sd[band yells SALOME, NO!]
- E. Fitness Administration :sd[band yells THE FITNESSGRAM PACER TEST IS A MULTISTAGE AEROBIC CAPACITY TEST THAT PROGRESSIVELY GETS MORE DIFFICULT AS IT CONTINUES!] and
- F. The Princeton Band

Pick up your BS in BS and watch now as the band plays Johnny B.A. in Underwater Basketweaving.

In order to honor St. Johnohnathan’s international campus in Limerick, Ireland, we have written this limerick for you:

Our trip to Columbia couldn’t occur\
So on another game we had to concur\
Normally we play quote unquote FOOT ball,\
But here they really put their feetsies on the ball\
Man, soccer, I hardly know her!

Remember! Being a starving artist is hard, so watch now as the band asks you to venmo them some Brown Bear Bucks.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Brown Bear]

Thank you for participating in our “usually humorous and frequently rude” time-honored tradition (not that you had any choice in the matter). Brown Band Out.
