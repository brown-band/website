::script-note[This script was almost entirely rejected. Direction from Cornell Athletics: “Your announcing script for your performance is not approved. Please refrain from any negative comments about Cornell, Ithaca, our athletics department, or our request for your script to be approved.” Later direction included the request to “Please remove F. The Princeton Band.” -AF]

## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that had hoped to perform a quote pointless rant unquote, but after much negotiation has settled on whatever you’re about to hear, it’s the Brown University “we sure hope constraints do in fact lead to better art” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hello Cornell and Neighboring Institutions. We are coming to you live from the beautiful city of Ithaca and Surrounding Communities. It is a beautiful day. The sun is shining. The football is oblong. We have no negative feelings to express about the process of submitting a script for content review. Watch now as the band carefully directs its criticism only toward a certain so-called elite university in Rhode Island and plays Any Way Cornell Athletics Wants It (That’s The Way They’ll Get It?)

:sd[Band forms X and plays Any Way You Want It]

In order to ensure our script maintains its relevance to the athletic contest at hand, we figured we ought to stick only to events that are happening at the moment. Like me reading this sentence. Or how a few minutes ago some esteemed gentlemen were tossing the ol’ pigskin around. Oh, look - there are some people in brown jackets running around and yelling. That’s weird. Now someone in an official-looking uniform is approaching me very quickly and- hey wait, get off me! Hey! No! :sd[sounds of a struggle] :sd[in a differently-pitched voice] watch now as the band does what it’s told for once and plays, um, Go Brown? Cheer for Brown? I don’t actually know what songs you play.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays For Bruno and 4 Brown]

Catch us at halftime when the band toes the yardline, marches to a drumbeat distinctly not its own, and delivers a mostly inoffensive performance!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has been properly chastised and is currently genuflecting at the feet of Big Athletics, it’s the Brown University “repent, reflect, recycle” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

It has come to our attention that at our last visit to this most esteemed institution, we may have unintentionally butted into your time-honored tradition of scheduling exams on Saturdays. Just think of all those chickens who were working so hard to become lawyers, only to have their LSATs be interrupted by some marching band, whoever that was. At least they have long, or maybe short, futures as Cornell Chickens—if they can’t be legally blonde at least they can be legally bland. Watch now as the band tucks a napkin into our shirt collar, prepares to dig in, and plays Poultry in the U.S.A

:sd[Band forms X and plays Party in the U.S.A]

I know that didn’t sound like an apology, so to continue in the spirit of reconciliation, we thought we’d come up with a list of things that are bigger and better at Cornell than at Brown.

:::script-list

- A. The number of significant figures in your admissions rate
- B. Quantity of campuses in Qatar (hello Education City!)
- C. A bell tower with real bells
- D. A bigger, redder bear mascot
- E. Your literal actual spell book collection
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band begs Big Red for forgiveness and plays Ding, Dong, We Were Wrong.

:sd[Band forms X and plays Ding Dong Song.]

In all seriousness, though, we’ve had two years to think about our actions, and we’re really, really sorry. We didn’t mean to read a fried chicken recipe instead of a halftime script. Sparing you in favor of solely making fun of one of your Neighboring Institutions was an honest mistake. And we see now that joking about licking Petri dishes was in poor taste, pun very much not intended. Watch now as the band is let out of the time out corner (we promise we’ll be good) and plays Bring The Victory, But Only If You Tell Us We Can.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Bring The Victory.]

We have exhausted our list of approved topics. Brown Band Out.
