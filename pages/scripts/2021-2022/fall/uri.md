## Pregame

:sd[tap tap tap] is this thing on? Yeah? Man, it’s been a while.\
Ahem, etc. :sd[do this for as long as it takes for other people in the press box to check whether you’re actually choking]\
For the first time in almost two years………. Ladies and gentlemen! Friends and alumni! Presenting an organization that’s thrilled to finally be pumping its trombone slides in a group again, it’s the Brown University “No More Masquerading!” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

SO, TO RECAP: WE’RE BACK IN BROWN, BABY!!!!! THE BEARS ARE LOOSE ON THE FIELD AND READY TO EAT SOME FISH AND NUTS AND BERRIES!!!! We’ve been hibernating for, like, the last eighteen months or so, but hopefully nothing important happened while we were asleep. Like an election or a global pandemic or low rise jeans coming back in style or something. Now that would be an international tragedy.\
Hold on to your mom jeans with your razor sharp claws and watch now as the Band guts a raw salmon with its teeth, contracts sixteen discrete varieties of foodborne illness, and sues Big Salmon to the tune of I Want My Money Back.

:sd[the band forms a fish and plays I Want You Back].

What’s up, URI? Are you ready to lose the Governor’s Cup for the second year in a row?\
:sd[pause for jeering]\
Alright, technically you didn’t lose last year. BUT YOU DIDN’T WIN, EITHER, and that should be making you pretty nervous. After all, we just came off our best season in years: you’re looking at last season’s reigning Ivy League Champs! It was an eight-way tie, with all uninvolved parties receiving a nonparticipation trophy. Can we do it again? No. :sd[pause] Because the odds of an eight-way tie are astronomical.

Put up a giant foam finger of your choice, enjoy being on top while it lasts, and watch now as the Brown Band celebrates its spitty, spitty return to the field by playing Bring the Victory.

:sd[the band forms a B and plays Bring the Victory].

Catch us at halftime when the band speaks out against the oppressive regime of industrialized agriculture.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves a good conspiracy, it’s the Brown University “Aww, it’s so cute that you still believe in the moon,” BAND!

Alright, now that we’re officially back from hibernation, we’ve been catching up on the news. From what we can tell, society as we know it is ending and it’s all… hold on, we’ve got some conflicting information here… :sd[papers rustle into mic]. Right. It’s all the fault of GMOs. According to our research, humanity went wrong approximately ten thousand years ago, when the first crops were domesticated. Everything since then has been downhill. All I want to do is hunt deer and gather nut snacks, but some idiot nomad thousands of years ago just had to go and figure out you can selectively breed plants for better nutritional outcomes and now I have to go to work. Screw you, Neolithic revolution.\
Reject subsistence farming, throw off your trowels, and watch now as the band reverts to an ancient lifestyle where nothing can go wrong and plays Pompeii.

:sd[the band forms a volcano and plays Pompeii].

Despite the global spread of a deadly virus (agriculture), plenty of people are continuing with life as normal. Corn prices are up seven percent so far this year.\
Here’s a list of other things that are up at least seven percent:

:::script-list

- A. Fertilizer runoff in Orlando drinking water
- B. The average number of fingers per hand in the Backstreet Boys (alright)
- C. Having uncomfortable interactions on the street with vague acquaintances
- D. Not the URI Band
- E. The maximum capacity of The Butt
- F. The Princeton Band!

Watch now as the band tries to raise the vaccination rate on campus to 107 percent by giving out some booster jabs and playing The Injection That I Get.

:sd[the band forms a vaccine (needle) and plays The Impression That I Get].

Speaking of food, societal collapse, and totally plausible conspiracies, it’s 2021, which means that we’re only one short year away from eating each other. You think the dining hall lines are bad now? Wait until every third person gets culled for meatloaf.\
Until then, we’ll always have the McDonald’s drive thru.

Watch now as the Band hotwires a RipStik, wobbles down the side of the highway, gets pulled over, and still makes it 5 minutes before closing to order a Number Four with extra Soylent.

:sd[the band forms a B and plays #4]

Yum. Brown Band out.
