Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is rapidly approaching you with an offer you can’t morally refuse and a hot pink flyswatter at the ready in case you try, it’s the Brown University “salesmanship is next to Godsmanship” BAAAAND!

Hi! It’s [name] with the CCB subcommittee for cosmic horror! Has this ever happened to you? Has anything ever happened to you? Will anything ever happen again? From time to time, when I least expect it, it happens to me. Are you tired of it? Are you tired of it all? God, I’m so tired. THERE’S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY!

Put on your walking shoes, search in vain for something to dull the constant ache of existence, and watch now as the band plays half-heartedly with its Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. :sd[vary tone, forget who or where you are, etc until script reader is out of breath]

:sd[The band makes something that is blatantly a schlong and plays Wii Theme]

Good news! We have a solution for you, a cure-all that will truly, genuinely, without-a-doubt cure all! It will fix everything! God, it has to fix it! The alternative is unimaginable! With our new product, we guarantee you’ll be feeling. But don’t take it from us! Take it from six of our most-valued customers!

Watch now as the Band demos its use and plays “Shipping and Handling, fifteen point oh-oh-five easy payments of 27.99!”

:sd[The band forms the Amazon arrow and plays Shipping Up To Boston]

Wow! Just fifteen point oh-oh-five easy payments of twenty-seven ninety nine for all that! Relinquish your phone to the couch cushion crevasse, go for a long walk to the nearest payphone, and dial 1185-027-7402-498004-661-953-420-8657-BRUNO. AGAIN, that’s 402-3141596-95420-CPAX. ONE MORE TIME, that’s :sd[unidentifiable noises]. Send us your credit card number, social security number, mother’s maiden name, father’s maiden name, the name of the street you grew up on, the name of your favorite fictional street, five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, one thing you just can’t live without, and zero Brown University Bands, unless they’re playing “Call Me Maybe.”

:sd[The band forms a 5-leaved “palm tree” and plays Stacy’s Mom]

If you haven’t submitted your taxes by now, it’s already too late. God is dead. Happy Drugs Day. Brown Band Out.
