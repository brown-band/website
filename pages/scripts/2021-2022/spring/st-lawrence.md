Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that came here to play hockey and break ankles, and just ran out of hockey, it’s the Brown University “Dunking on the Olds” BAND!!!!

We’re thrilled to welcome a hockey team from that most prestigious of towns, birthplace of the great bard William Shakespeare himself… oh wait you’re in Bradford upon Avon, not Stratford. And you’re a college in America, not a high school in England. And the game’s over. We “regret” the “error.”\
Goodbye to a hockey team from an extremely average town somewhere in, like, the north or something. Whatever, who cares.\
Bid bye-bye to the boring bros from Bradford and behold as the Band bisits ba bore binteresting bown in the borth and blays Bskating Bup to Soston. :sd[long pause] uh…

Since nobody actually cares about Saint Bore-ance, we’d prefer to turn our attention to the real stars of the show: our crusty old alumni! Here’s a list of a few things our lovely alumni have been up to since they left the shade of these time honored walls and stepped into the blinding light of student loan repayment scheduling.

:::script-list

- A. Waiting for their diplomas to arrive in the mail
- B. Moving away from their ice cold bandiehood on the east coast to bask, uh, roast? In the bountifully flaming tracts of land in SoCal
- C. Consistently ignoring our emails soliciting $69 donations for this year’s raunchy collection of buttons
- D. Postponing adulthood by attaining master’s degrees in high-altitude basket-weaving
- E. Sliding ever closer towards the great big litterbox in the sky, and
- F. The Princeton Band!

Jokes aside, it’s good to see you all, alumni. If we behave, will you tell that story about the one time you saw Cpax’s husband walking a dog on the main green? Wow, so original. Thanks, alumni. Watch your ankles, ask if you need a hand getting out of the recliner, don’t strain yourself, and watch now as the Band returns to a time long since past and plays Time Warp.

As the Brown Band’s alumni can certainly attest, we have a deep understanding of the value of rehearsal, serious work ethic, and practice time. But we also understand that academics come before athletics (or at least within a couple of minutes of each other, if everybody involved is courteous) and therefore limit our rehearsals to a reasonable one hour per week. Unlike St. Lawrence’s hockey team, who tried to count to four and ended up at nine hours of practice. :sd[band yells “YOU CAN’T DO THAT”]. Watch now as the band values the hard work, dedication, and math skills of our own overeducated alums and plays Nine B​​runo and Nine Brown.
