Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is attempting to acclimate to the inevitable onset of a nuclear winter, it’s the Brown University “Ukrainin’ our neck to look for ICBMs” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Brr. Is it just us, or is it a little chilly in here? We thought we signed up for water sports, but it’s become increasingly clear that, out of all eleventy thousand tons of Meehan Auditorium, NOT ONE POUND of it is swimmable. Well, whatever. We may not be able to walk on water, but we can do you one better. Watch now as the band feeds ten thousand hungry undergrads with one meal swipe, turns water into Orange Guava Passion Fruit Juice, and, for its final trick, swims on land while playing "I Run Aground.”

:sd[Band forms a ship and plays I Get Around.]

:sd[advertiser voice] Are you bored with the traditional winter sports? Tired of the Olympics? Do you just want a break from it all? Have we got the sports for you! May we suggest:

:::script-list

- A. Asynchronous swimming — perfect for these uncertain times
- B. Horse surfing 2a — The horse is on the board now
- BB. Horse surfing 2c — The horse is the board now
- BBB. Horse surfing 2e — You are a horse. Do you want to [stop surfing] or [do a backflip]?
- :sd[in a different voice:] [do a backflip] You fall, breaking your horse legs and horse face. GAME OVER: You have died of dysentery.
- C. wokesurfing — the only waves we're riding are the politically correct ones
- D. skeleton — what you'll be if you take a dip in a piranha filled lake
- E. Underwater ankle ribbon wrestling — this one’s actually real
- E. Cement shoe diving — popular with the folks we paid off to ensure smooth skating tonight
- E. waterboarding — Dubya's favorite sport! and
- F. The Princeton band

Time to quit horsin’ around! Watch now as the band puts the surfboard before the horse and plays Hang Ten My Wayward Steed!

Neigh, matey! It looks like our brief adventure as ocean-faring sea men is over. It’s been fun, but now it’s about time we come out of the water and head over to the locker rooms to shower off all the salt. Thanks to the generous donations of our alumni, we've recently been able to upgrade all of our facilities! The band locker rooms are now equipped with solid gold fixtures. Unfortunately, we could only afford one set, so we might have to go as a group — not that we’re completely unfamiliar with such an arrangement. Watch now as the band enters a 24-karat shower and plays In The Spray.

:sd[Band performs the counterskate and plays In the Fray]

We hope that w(h)et your appetite. See you soon when you least expect it! Brown Band Out.
