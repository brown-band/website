Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just joined Silver Singles dot com, it’s the Brown University “help i’ve fallen for you and i can’t get up - because the ice is slippery and not because I’m no longer young nor spry” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Oh ho ho, FIFTY YEARS on ice. What a long time it’s been.\
The Brown Band has seen a lot since we first strapped on our skates and defied our insurance policy in the name of musical discovery. So we now invite all of you to reflect with us on how far we’ve come from five decades ago. You know, when ice was frozen, bands were terrestrial, and band alumni were men. Yeah, deep in the past.\
Luckily, dear audience, it’s February 14, 2020, and our society has finally cast off oppressive gender norms, heteronormativity, and land-based bands. Well, the last part is true.

So watch now as the band buys a box of chocolates, calls in a dinner reservation, checks out _The Notebook_ on VHS from the library, and plays Capitalistically in Love.

Take it from the Band’s skating career: It’s hard being single in your fifties. The kids only visit once or twice a year, your landlord keeps trying to kick you out and move you to a smaller practice room, and millennials are once again killing the button industry. Fortunately for you, the Band, in its ripe old age, has some foolproof tips and tricks to make the most of dating in your golden years:

- A. Stock up on… uhhh... Herbal Supplements
- B. Don’t be afraid to Wheel of Fortune and Chill
- C. Refill your prescription for Rectix
- D. Take advantage of the early bird specials for a more intimate, empty-restaurant feel
- E. Lower your standards and
- F. The Princeton band

That said, maybe taming a tiger isn’t worth the tears.\
Instead, just loosen your suspenders, pop out your dentures, give your nurse the afternoon off and watch now as the Brown Band takes you on a self-guided tour to the tune of Lazy in Love.

Even though we, as an organization, are getting it up in years, we’d like to think we’re still coming to the peak of our career. After all, it’s not the length of an organization’s ice skating tenure that matters; it’s the endurance during the show that counts. And, as far as a Valentine’s date goes, you could do far worse than the Brown University Band. Pros: we’ve got lots of experience blowing trumpets, banging drums, and licking reeds. Cons: not many, but if we had to pick a few: we’re a bit scatter-brained, it takes us a minute to get going, and after that you might want to put in earplugs.

Let’s be honest: nobody really wants to be alone on Valentine’s Day. So allow us to introduce our friend Elrod, grease up our trombone slide, and get our skates tangled as we play In the Hay.
