Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just upgraded its physics engine, it’s the Brown University “Watch out, the ice is now realistically slippery” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

With the band’s 50th anniversary on ice just past, we’re taking this opportunity to reflect on years gone by. Technology sure has come a long way in the last few decades. Does anyone remember what passed for video games when we were kids? Like cool math games dot com. Or google earth flight simulator. Or type to learn. We sure are glad those days are over - now we’ve got amazing video games like Breath of the Wild, Skyrim, and … still cool math games dot com. Go figure. Literally.\
Put your backpack in your cubby, boot up the old Dell modem, pull up your dubiously educational game of choice and watch now as the band downloads a virus onto the school computer (Sorry Ms. Luellen!) and plays Gotta Catch ‘Em All (Spyware!)

While we’re reminiscing, let’s talk about some of our favorite childhood video games, although we admit we were in a rush so we didn’t do a great job describing them:

:::script-list

- C. Pop bubbles with your vampire head-spike
- D. Ride your horse up a mountain sideways

Ah, oui, the most underrated console of all time: the Wii. Allow us to tell you what the Band loves most about Wii-ing. Wii Skii, for instance. Or putting your Mii into Wii Skii. Or Feeling carefree and full of glee while eating chickpea brie and drinking tea in a tree by the sea while playing wii skii with your mii.\

Into the Fray is a fast action-shooter in the vein of Doom and Dark Messiah; using fast combat, reactive environments, and traps. Blast, kick, and dash your way through Rebels and Eldrich creatures to liberate the Isle of Portland; as it becomes consumed by fog and horrors.\
