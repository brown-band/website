Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is the band, it’s the Brown University “we are the band and that’s good enough” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hello everyone. We are the Brown University Band, and we skate on ice. And we would like to say that we think that should be enough for you. We agree that it is unreasonable for us to say that you shouldn’t expect to be entertained, but that is a lot of qualifying, and we also agree that it is unreasonable for the hockey rink to be covered in ice while we are trying to perform a concert. We’re not asking for anything crazy. Just…\
We think the ice should be heated. And I’m not going to - the Band is not going to just roll over on this one. My feet are cold and my hands hurt and my nose is running and I don’t - the Band doesn’t - want to be here right now because I have a lot of homework and - the Band has a lot of homework and my - our pants are giving my knees a rash. So if you don’t think we can skate, or if you think we can’t play in tune enough to get in to middle school honors band, maybe you’re right, but also, maybe you should go jump in front of a moving bridge. Yeah, that’s how I feel.

Watch now as the Band tells it like it is and plays Every Little Thing We Do Is Magic.

:sd[Band forms a star and play Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic.]

Hey you! Yeah you! Stop making fun of us. Quit it. Stop. Don’t laugh at our wondrous force of nature before you. We’re not performing for you. You might think it’s cute to watch a band put on their skates and slide around on the ice, but as a representative of PETB, or People for the Ethical Treatment of Bands, I can assure you that this behavior is NOT cute or natural. Bands only skate like this when they are under immense stress, like when they’re:

:::script-list

- A. Shopping seven classes, all Monday/Wednesday/friday from 1-2, and all are concentration requirements
- B. Recovering from mono after a marathon spit-spit-swallow tournament
- C. Receiving an email after their thesis advisor sees their first chapter and only replies, “I have concerns. We need to meet. Immediately.”
- D. Constantly rethinking how many exclamation points they should use in formal writing (It’s two you only need two)
- E. Trying to figure out what’s going to happen when after graduation in 3.5 months (help), and
- F. The Princeton band

Throw off your skates, take all your classes S/NC, and watch now as the band plays Tricked into PLME.

:sd[Band forms a sad face and plays Hooked on a Feeling.]

As a final act of protest against the harsh realities of skating band life, the scriptwriters are going on strike. Please enjoy the following abstract section while we take a bagel break:\

Joke Machine Broke. So, watch now band play Brain Wires Frayed. Please clap after.
