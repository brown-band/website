## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that really appreciates French poetry, it’s the Brown University “wee wee baguette” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

_Il y a une seule fois que la beauté de la nature m’a enveloppé complètement. C’est en l’année vent-cent-huit, juste comme je pataugeais sur la plage de Nice. L’eau tiède était jusqu’aux genoux. Mes cheveux et mon short de bain avaient la même teinte de jaune-vert vif. Ma poitrine nue brillait dans l’air salé, complètement sans poils. Mes abdos volés ondulaient comme des vagues sur mon corps élancé. Je me plais à plonger au sein de mon image. Je l’embrasses des yeux et des bras, et mon coeur se distrait quelquefois de sa propre rumeur au bruit de cette plainte indomptable et sauvage. J’ai alors compris le bonheur absolu._ Watch now as the band gets snow in their face and plays Johnny L. Mamater.

:sd[Band forms a snowflake and plays Johnny B. Goode.]

The Band just \*really\* appreciates France in general. Some people think that the Band is a bit odd, but in France they would be totally normal! Here are some things the French do that the Band thinks should be done everywhere:

:::script-list

- A. Eats cheese for dessert
- B. Put fish on each other’s backs
- C. Marry their… “step-friends”, dead or alive
- D. Have a free “special glove” fund for students
- E. Assumes right of way when carrying onions and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band draws you like one of your French girls and plays Monet, Monet, Monet.

:sd[Band forms Favorite Form and plays Favorite Song.]

France also has cats. I LOVE fat cats!!!! (chuckle) Chonky. There is a cat in the woods. For some people, the cat is easy to see. Others don’t see it at all. Some people say the cat is tame. Others say it’s vicious and dangerous. Since no one can really be sure who’s right, isn’t it smart to be as strong as the cat? If there is a cat.\
Watch now as the Band visits the town neighboring La Croix, France and plays Fire Cat Bear.

Catch us at halftime when the Band recreates act two of Les Mis. Brown Band out.

## Halftime

Theydies and Gentlethems, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that owes a lot to Rhymezone.com, it’s the Brown University “I guess adoption technically does rhyme with Wisconsin, but is that helpful?” BAND!

Sorry Dartmouth, we didn’t write a script about you - we were too busy doing much more important things, like making fun of our senior citizens. Watch now as the Band makes some really suspect rhymes and honors our graduating class of 2020 through the art of poetry.

Grayson hails from New Hampshire\
Our emo in lumberjack couture\
Writing talent for miles\
And sick flannel styles\
Of witchcraft, she’s a conno-isseur

From H-town comes our tapping queen\
Plays melodica and flute so serene\
If upon Halle you wait\
She’ll be sleeping in late\
Insult her cats and she’ll surely be mean

If you’re looking for Ingrid: think cheesehead\
Who with censorship’s always displeasèd\
She’s our favorite bone licker\
PLME pride never flickers\
Brings us baggels, but no, she can’t eat bread (GF)

With the band website Summer’s so handy\
Pockets filled to the brim with hard candy\
She commutes quite the mile\
For swear words, says “Kyle!”\
And on sax takes her last breaths as granny

Heidy is our favorite Mass lady\
And just ask ‘bout her love for Tom Brady\
At games hear her yell\
“Shirts off for Cornell”\
Murders Dorle while she figure skate-y

Harry, a bandie from New York\
Did research at Los Alamos on quark\
He solved some equations\
In the lab at Brookhaven\
And as PRR pictures he toork

The original melodica player\
Sofia, our Music Concentrator\
This major has flaws\
For example: no jobs\
But she knows so stop being a hater

Accepted as a PLME admit\
Fan of the interpretive twerk it\
Jared’s the tip of the band\
Follow @c0mic_sans (pronounce @ as “at”)\
“If you didn’t grow it, don’t smoke it”

Some of his kinks...they really be whack\
But-we-love Kelvin to Hong Kong and back\
He learned ESL\
He flew, then he fell\
And still thinks he’s somehow high impact

There once was a PLME named John\
Who Matty McG would dunk on\
His math know-how’s sublime\
But his baking’s a crime\
So it’s meal swipes - for Gus, Ingrid n’ Sean

Congrats, seniors! Try not to break a pelvis on your way off the field. Catch us next season as the Band only visits its graduates to beg for cash.

Ok boomer. Brown Band Out.
