## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that briefly forgot where it put its wallet, it’s the Brown University “where’d our money go? Oh, wait, we never lost it” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey, Columbia band, not to freak you out or anything, but we want to let you know that you’re being watched. Every step you take, every move you make, they’ll be watching you. Who, the FBI agents that live in your laptop? - the ones Edward Snowden tried to warn you about last week? No. It’s much worse than that. Columbia band, you’re now being tailed by… UFOs. They can read your phone records, your text messages, and even your student-arranged sheet music - talk about advanced technology. So put on your tinfoil hat, maybe make a diplomatic call to a certain eastern European country, and complain about the First Amendment while we play Party in the U-Kr-Aine.

The Brown Band has been to Columbia almost a hundred times by now, but we have to say, something about this fine Saturday afternoon feels… new. It smells like a fresh start in here, and it got us thinking about how much we love reboots. And who doesn’t appreciate a good comeback? Here are a few of our favorite revivals:

:::script-list

- A. Spiderman again
- B. Terminator 5: Genysis
- C. New Coke
- D. Do you know Joe?
- E. Spiderman the first time
- F. The Col- \*cough\*... Princeton band

Pull out your laptop, start a GoFundMe to get this thing off the ground, take a vacation to Bogotá, and watch now as the band plays Raise Your Funds.

Okay, Columbia, speaking of reboots, we think it’s time to admit the Tim Curry It movie from 1990 wasn’t aaaaaaaaaallllllllll bad. If you think about it, there were plenty of great moments! For instance, it was really cool when… uh… huh. Nevermind, that movie was actually seriously terrible. But the reboot really redeemed the franchise in the public eye! Here’s hoping every other reboot is just as successful as It (2016). Sit back, relax, hire a new project manager and watch now as the band rings in your homecoming and plays Clown Band Reborn.

Joe Mama. Brown Band Out.
