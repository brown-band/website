## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just \*slightly\* overbaked its apple pie, it’s the Brown University “yeah, this looks a bit crustier than usual” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Welcome back, alumni!\
We’re glad you’ve decided to join us for the Brown-URI rivalry game, a time-honored tradition since 1909 - almost as old as some of you alums. We’re sure glad you all broke out of your respective assisted living facilities to be here today. We’d ask you to help us carry the Governor’s Cup home, but we’re worried you might break a hip in the process.\
Put in your dentures, hike up your velvet track pants and watch now as the band disrespects its elders and plays Stacey’s Great Grand-Mom

We wanted our alumni to feel comfortable while back at Brown, so we decided to list some comforting \*old stuff\* that may have been on Brown’s campus back in your day. Here are some of the things from your college days that we could dig up in the Rock archives:

:::script-list

- A. University Hall serving as your dorm, your classroom, and Providence’s hottest up-and-coming club
- B. The sets used to fake the moon landing in a Grad Center dorm
- C. George Washington’s visit to campus for Spring Lecture Board
- D. An Ivy League Championship-winning football team
- E. Riding dinosaurs on the Main Green during Spring Weekend, and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band shuffles into place and plays Aging Forevermore.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that also doesn’t sit with a lot of people at lunch, it’s the Brown University “maybe if we didn’t lose 3 games in a row people would like us” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Look URI, as a five-letter school at last count, we at Brown can understand that it’s tough for you to build a brand. So don’t worry, we totally forgive you about the asbestos in Davis Hall, and we’ll admit, we were even a little flattered that your residential office decided to take a cue from ours. And hey, it seems things might be trending up, with those 4 and a half million clams you just picked up to do research on as many slimy, slimy oysters as you can shuck. (Of course, if you’re in need of new samples, we hope you’ll pay a visit to Cornell.) But as much as we hate to be that guy, we will put in our two cents: Changing the name of your largest dining hall would be an easy fix. We might call ours the Ratty, but picking up a steaming serving of wieners in The Butt just doesn’t sit right for most of us.

Watch now as the band eats out and plays We’re All In The Butt Together.

So yeah URI, you have an image problem. But we truly believe that if you took the right steps, you could find that REAL YOU. Just think about all of the other prominent organizations with your initials! Like United Refrigeration Inc. - _one of the largest distributors of refrigeration, air conditioning and heating parts and equipment in North America. Founded in 1947 in Philadelphia, United Refrigeration now has locations in the United States and Canada_- the real Mr. Worldwide.\
And what about URI, The Stock™? Yahoo explains that _United Rentals is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. With a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 38% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3 it is hard to get too excited about the stock_. And isn’t that just riveting.

See URI, all you need is a little inspiration to make your consonant sandwich POP. Those three little letters just might rule the world one day.

Our alumni might remember how good things were in the old days, but lately it seems like they’re only getting better. We did a little research this week and found out that URI is hurtling into the future. For one, you guys have finally arrived in the distant year of 2011 and acquired your own podcast! So modern!

And another KERNEL fer ya (ho ho ho) - as monopolistic agribusiness tightens its choke hold on the country, we keep finding new ways to base our diets in corn. This month, thanks to URI professor Rebecca **Brown** (no known relation), we’re now using LASER SCARECROWS to protect that prized crop from the Bob Government’s pesky birds.

Finally, we’re excited to see you’ve invited Big Brother to campus with your ever-present Quad Cams. Now we understand why you’re always censoring us - thoughtcrime is a big deal in Airstrip One. Don’t worry, though; there’s nothing the band loves more than having an audience. Always there. Always watching.

Watch now as the band pines for 1984 and plays Big Brother-Bear.

Catch us next week as the Band worships like a dog, tells you its sins, and lets you sharpen your knife for the game against Holy Cross. Brown Band Out.
