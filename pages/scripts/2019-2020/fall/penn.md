## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just woke up from its Benadryl nap and can’t wait to go trick-or-treating, it’s the Brown University “what do you mean it’s November second” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hello Penn! We’d just like to start by saying: thank you! Last time we saw you, we got some super helpful career advice. We were planning on going to med school, but thankfully a Wharton bandie let us know that, quote, “Med school is a bad investment.” Wow! Thanks for the heads up! Everyone knows doctors are really in it for the money and not, you know, saving people’s lives. Thanks to you, the band has decided on a new, much more stable career path: the theatre! We’ve got our new costumes all made up and we’re ready to hit the stage.\
Watch now as the Band demonstrates how we all were PLMEs at the start and plays We Are All Making Good Investments Together.

:sd[Band forms X and plays We’re All In This Together.]

Bad news, Penn. We invested all our money in the theatre like you said, but unfortunately Spiderman on Ice was a critical flop. Turns out the ice is slippery and not at all conducive to the sick flips and tricks that really made the show work. Nobody wants to pay a hundred and eighty dollars to see Spiderman break a leg. Literally.\
Call your proud Penn alumni parents, borrow your dad’s credit card, and watch now as the band plays On the Great White Way.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays In The Fray.]

Catch us at halftime when the band gets its economics degree and graduates magna cum LOUD.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is mentally salivating at the idea of having access to past exams for all their classes, it’s the Brown University “the answer is always C” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

And now, we’d like to take a moment to honor UPenn’s founder, Benjamin Franklin. We’re so deeply moved to see his noble tradition of taking credit for stuff that other people invented continues to this very day. Because where would alum Elon Musk and his new invention “Trains” be without Ben Franklin’s enterprising attitude? Just think what the headlines in the Pennsylvania Gazettysburg must have looked like back then!\
:script-tab _Area man ignores severe weather alert and discovers fun size lightning!_\
:script-tab _Local tinkerer credited with introducing the wheel to Pennsylvania drops tobacco pipe on gerbil bedding, creating new way to keep your hardtack warm in the winter._\
:script-tab _Single-handed inventor of glasses, books, and substituting courting partners for public dances with one’s mother tells all- in new periodical written for poor men named Dick!_

Absolutely illuminating, especially thanks to all this electric light, which was invented by Benjamin Franklin.

Watch now as the band ponders at how much individuals change the course of human history on their own without any dependence on the people around them and plays I Do It All By Myself.

:sd[Band forms X and plays I Touch Myself.]

Now, you, you The University of Pennsylvania you, oh yes you. You may know ALLLLLLL (swirls head in circle) about Benny Frank’s inventions, but here’s a few things you probably didn’t know about that great American:

:::script-list

- A. His series of columns written as a middle-aged woman named Silence Dogood
- B. The long kiss he shared with George Washington on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the inauguration of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
- C. Hot Wheels, BEAT THAT
- D. The cheesesteak Benjamin and George shared on that sweet-smelling March afternoon is preserved in the Van Pelt Library
- E. 877 (pause) 241 (beep boop beep boop) LUNA and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band demands a fair shake for Benny Boy and plays Dr. Inventor.

As you probably know, we got here on a bus, which is also known as the bandwagon. We're glad it's not a SEPTA bus. Your SEPTA, short for the Society for Elimination of Public Transit in America, is a top-class government-sponsored corporation. We know that a transit authority that put up advertisements that optimistically pronounced, "We're getting there!" does a great job of actually getting people somewhere, right? The brainchild of Penn professor Vukan Vuchic, your tax dollars went into building a cathedral tunnel underneath the center of Philadelphia and blowing up a gasoline truck that was crossing the Fox Chase rail line when a derelict Bud RDC failed to trigger the crossing gates. Now watch now as the band goes on strike and drives For Buses and For Trains.

[Band forms a B and plays For Bruno and For Brown]

We just took a DNA test, turns out, we’re 100% free from the contagious disease Universitas Pennsylvaniensis. Brown Band Out.
