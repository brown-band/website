## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just woke up from its Benadryl nap and can’t wait to go trick-or-treating, it’s the Brown University “what do you mean it’s November second” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hello Penn! Last time we saw you, we got some super helpful career advice. We were planning on going to med school, but thankfully a Wharton bando let us know that, quote, “Med school is a bad investment.” Wow! Thanks for the heads up! Thanks to you, the band has decided on a new, much more stable career path: the theatre! We’ve got our costumes all made up and we’re ready to hit the stage.\
Watch now as the Band demonstrates how we all were PLMEs at the start and plays We’re All Making Good Investments Together.

:sd[Band forms an investment portfolio and plays We’re All In This Together.]

Bad news, Penn. We invested all our money in the theatre, but unfortunately Spiderman on Ice was a critical flop. Turns out the ice is slippery and not at all conducive to all the sick flips and tricks that really made the show work. Nobody wants to pay a hundred and eighty dollars to see Spiderman break a leg. Literally.\
Call your proud Penn alumni parents, borrow your dad’s credit card, and watch now as the band plays On the Great White Way.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays In The Fray.]

Catch us at halftime when the band gets its economics degree and graduates magna cum LOUD.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is mentally salivating at the idea of having access to past exams for all their classes, it’s the Brown University “the answer is always C” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

And now, we’d like to take a moment to honor UPenn’s founder, Benjamin Franklin. We’re so deeply moved to see his noble tradition of taking credit for stuff that other people invented continue. Where would Elon Musk and his invention “Trains” be without Ben Franklin’s ingenuity? Just think what the headlines in the Pennsylvania Gazettysburg must have looked like back then:\
_Area man ignores severe weather alert and discovers fun size lightning!_\
_Single-handed inventor of glasses, books, and bringing one’s mother to public dances tells all - in new periodical written for poor men named Dick!_

Watch now as the band ponders at how much individuals change the course of human history without any dependence on the people around them and plays I Do It All By Myself.

:sd[Band forms a lightbulb and plays I Touch Myself.]

Now, you, you The University of Pennsylvania you, oh yes you. You may know ALLLLLLL (swirls head in circle) about Benny Frank’s inventions, but here’s a few things you probably didn’t know about him:

:::script-list

- A. His series of columns written as a middle-aged woman named Silence Dogood
- B. The passionate kiss shared with George Washington on the Lincoln Memorial
- C. Hot Wheels, BEAT THAT
- D. The cheesesteak Benjamin and George shared on that sweet-smelling March afternoon is preserved in the Van Pelt Library
- E. 877 :sd[pause] 241 :sd[beep boop beep boop] LUNA and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band demands a fair shake for Benny Boy and plays Dr. Inventor.

:sd[Band forms a milkshake and plays Doctor Worm.]

As you probably know, we got here on a bus, which is also known as the bandwagon. We’re glad it’s not a SEPTA bus. Your SEPTA, short for the Society for Elimination of Public Transit in America, is a top-class government-sponsored corporation. A transit authority that pronounces “We’re getting there!” must do a great job of getting people somewhere! Your tax dollars went into building a cathedral tunnel underneath the center of Philadelphia and blowing up a gasoline truck. Watch now as the band goes on strike and drives For Buses and For Trains.

[Band forms a B and plays For Bruno and For Brown]

We just took a DNA test, turns out, we’re 100% free from the contagious disease Universitas Pennsylvaniensis. Brown Band Out.
