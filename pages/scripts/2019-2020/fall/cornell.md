## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants to get up close and personal with all your sportsballs, it’s the Brown University “Lonesome Polecat - that’s the name of a football thing” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We’ve heard about an up and coming player in the league, first spotted in 2017 at a THURSDAY THURSDAY THURSDAY night football game. Here’s what league experts Tony Romo and Jim Nantz had to say about Stray Cat #1:\
“So look at this, Jim. This is how you ran in high school.”\
“Exactly.”\
“Look at that. Perfect form. Extension. I mean, and it doesn’t even get fazed if there’s people around”\
“Ooo! Look at the change in direction. Does he get both feet in right here at the end, Jim? He’s in!”\
“He turns it upfield!”\
“That’s way too much fun at this point. I feel like we’re just in that tired mode where you’re delirious …”

Watch now as the Band signs this new player for sicks point nein meow-llion and plays The Commentators That We Get.

That commentary on a grey cat playing football was about as much as we understand of pig (or maybe cat?) skin gridiron. Oh wait, we just found a video explaining how it works from Disney in 1944. Apparently the goal is “to advance the ball over the pole line of the opposing team by hook or crook. There are 15 men on either end, two ends, and”. AAHH AAH AAHH AHH AHH AHH

Watch now as the band squares up for kickoff and gets TOTALLY In The Endzone.

Catch us at halftime when we lick Petri dishes and kiss each other and then swap Petri dishes and lick those too.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that hasn’t known the triumphs and defeats, the epic highs and lows of high school football, it’s the Brown University “it’s NOT a phase, mom” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hello opposing team! We know you don’t know what this feels like, but listen. We’re not sad, ok? We just want to go play American Football and hang out with our friends like a NORMAL BAND. Why can’t you just let us be ourselves‽ NO! This is who WE ARE. You just don’t get it. STOP! NO WE DON’T WANT A GRILLED CHEESE FOR DINNER. YES FINE TRIANGLES NOT RECTANGLES.

Watch now as the band slams its door and then cracks it open and plays Welcome to the Homecoming Parade but not too loud because we don’t want mom to ask us what’s wrong.

Fine. You wanna know what we like? Here:

- D. curating fringe that you can still see through while playing JV volleyball
- E. rawr xD, and
- F. The Princeton band

I’m not like other girls, and I’ll show you. Watch now as the band sets up camp at Hot Topic and plays I Write Sins not Band Tees.

“About three things the band is absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him—and we didn’t know how potent that part might be—that thirsted for our blood. And third, we were unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.”\
Watch now as the band waits for a thunderstorm, steps up to the plate, and plays Modern Baseball in Forks, Washington.

No we DON’T LIKE JOHNNY. Brown Band Out.
