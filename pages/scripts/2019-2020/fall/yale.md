## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s beating off, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past, it’s the Brown University “Oof ouch ow my generational wealth” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey Yale! We’re glad you made it out today - and honestly a little surprised. We dug up one of your old academic codes of conduct, and we gotta say, it sounds like the Yalies of old didn’t get out much. Seriously, no cardplaying allowed? It’s a good thing your admissions team decided to loosen up application requirements last semester. Now all it takes to join your ranks is a Common App, 1.2 million dollars, and a fake instagram account!\
Watch now as the Band shows that \~anyone can be a varsity soccer player\~ (unless you’re part of the Ivy League Championship-winning Brown team!) and plays Stacy’s Mom Got Her Into Yale.

:sd[Band forms a dollar sign and plays Stacy’s Mom.]

We don’t blame you too much, Yale - you’ve gotta make money somehow. Clearly you’re doing something right, with that 29 billion dollar endowment. And while Brown’s got only 4 billion, we’re growers, and we know how to use our little endowment in a way that matters.\
Watch now as the band steps out of a shower of cold hard cash and plays Brown Bear Bare.

Catch us at halftime when the band makes an omelette by cracking a few nest eggs.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that finally figured out what Yale really is, it’s the Brown University “K-mart of Harvard” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey, Yale, why don’t you come into the family room and sit down for a minute? We’re not angry. We love you, but everyone’s getting worried. This has got to stop - the names of your a capella groups are just too weird. Seriously, when our mom saw we tried to book the “Whiffenpoofs” and “Spizzwinks” for a weekend gig, we got the birds and bees talk. And also grounded. Watch now as the band borrows our mom’s credit card, busts out the yellow pages, shreds the phone bill and plays Call Me Up, Buttercup.

:sd[Band forms a telephone and plays Build Me Up, Buttercup.]

Wait, Yale - don’t interrupt, the Brown Band still has the talking pillow. Yes, your names are weird, and it’s going to be a long, slow process of recovery. But we’re here to help. Here’s a few ideas we had for some new a capella group names:

:::script-list

- A. The Deep Throats
- B. Aural Intensity
- C. The Worthless Peons (if you’re into that)
- D. Choral Fixation
- E. The Hoosier Daddies and
- F. The Princeton band

So watch now as the band complains about intonation and plays Come on Eileen.

The Band used to think that they were Gutenberg’s gift to creation, but an article in the Yale Daily News about the female organism says otherwise. In October, Yale researchers said that their and their rabbits’ “neuro-endocrine reflex is too complex to be an evolutionary accident,” and that therefore all female organisms have a biological purpose! Anyways, through some pretty big jumps in logic, your researchers were able to determine that humans are exactly the same as camels and cats too! That’s why the Band always bats your Gutenberg’s cookbook off the counter- because it’s secretly a cat and not a human! We never would have known that the female organism even existed if it weren’t for you! Thanks, Yale!\
Watch now as the band proves the importance of the female organism and plays Bring the Evolutionary Victory.

You want to know our piping hot take? Ghosting is disrespectful to ghosts. Brown Band Out.
