Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that recently contracted the West Nile Virus, it’s the Brown University “wait, it’s not just a river in Egypt?!” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey Bryant- we heard that you made a tiiiiiny mistake and forgot that you don’t have any lights at your stadium, so you rescheduled our night game (no more secrets)! That’s a silly thing to forget, so we have a couple of questions for you:\
How many Bryant students does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Two. One to change the lightbulb and the other to say loudly that he did it as well as the Brown band.\
How many mosquitoes does it take to reschedule a football game? One, but only if it gets an E in all three of its classes. Alternatively, enough to suck more than than the football team.\
How many dollars would it take to get a “field show” for the Brown University Band? 69, but only if you pay in 4 20 dollar bills.\
Watch now as the Band re-re-reschedules the football game and plays Funky Game Time.

The Brown Band had EVEN MORE questions about Bryant, so we checked out the Frequently Asked Questions section of bryant.com to learn some more. We didn’t know that you sold heating equipment! These are the questions that we were able to have answered:

:::script-list

- A. Which Bryant equipment will best fit my home?
- B. Where can I get parts for my Bryant equipment?
- C. Massachusetts now has special venting requirements for furnaces. Can Bryant help me?
- D. Where can I find literature about my Bryant products, such as owner’s manuals, installation guides and product specifications?
- E. Why is the SEER rating on the Energy Guide different than what my Bryant dealer quoted? and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band asks Bryant about the benefits of a programmable heating system and turns its thermostat to Pretty High.

Brown and Bryant used to be best friends, but then Bryant got distracted by the money of a one Tupper Ware and we were left alone on College Hill to learn the true, dark backstory of the invention of tupperware.\
Tupperware was invented in 666 BCE when the leftovers of Tupper Zero had to be packed away in a microwave safe container. This event was actually what caused the end of the Bronze Age! Sir Tupper Ware, better known as Abraham Lincoln, was a vampire hunter in the wild fields of what would later be known as New Hampshire. He invented tupperware when he found that a doggie bag just wouldn’t cut it anymore.\
Watch now as the band packs up leftovers of Tupper Zero and leaves them in the fridge for 8 months, and plays Every Time We Tupperware.

We’re really excited that you got a new dog as your mascot named Tupper 2! We took some time to think of some really great nicknames for your new mascot, and we wanted to share our favorites with you. Maybe you’d like to call him Tupper 2: The Squeakuel. Or maybe you’d be a fan of Tupp and Tupperer: When Harry Met Lloyd. Or perhaps the classic Tupper 2: Electric Boogaloo.\
Watch now as the band doesn’t forget the tearjerker sequel and plays For Tupper 1 and For Tupper 2.

We stole your football coach. Brown Band Out.
