## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has never lost to San Diego, it‚Äôs the Brown University ‚Äú23 to 31, 25 or 6 to 4‚Äù BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Back in the year 2000, not much had changed and we didn‚Äôt live under water. Life was good, and your great-great-great granddaughter watched as the Brown Football team found themselves in the state of California.\
We played a first quarter. Then we played a second quarter. And then we played a third quarter. We also played a fourth quarter, but that messes up the rhythm of this script. At the end of it all, we came out victorious at 1-0-0 and we were doing fine. Doing fine. Watch now as the band builds a flux capacitor and plays Time Travel Ships.

:sd[Band forms the flux symbol and plays Starships.]

Hey Harvard, we noticed that you don‚Äôt actually know what your founder, John Harvard, looked like. The Band totally understands, as we‚Äôve had many a night we can‚Äôt completely remember. We‚Äôd like to think that John Harvard had double eyepatches. Or should we say, John H-ARRRR-vard. Or maybe he had a chin that was a bit chafed, thus giving namesake to you Crimson Chins. Or maybe he had adorable floppy dog ears, to protect his AirPods.\
Watch now as the band depicts their interpretation of the face of John Harvard and plays Harvard Man Reborn.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Brown Man Born.]

Catch us at halftime when the Band stands, as John Harvard did, like blushing pilgrims.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that only kills goats for ritualistic purposes, it‚Äôs the Brown University ‚Äúnot a cult‚Äù BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey, Harvard, we hear you‚Äôve decided to cancel your traditional goat roast this year. Too bad - there‚Äôs nothing the band loves more than a good ol‚Äô fashioned public goat skinning. Except maybe playing with pentagrams, attending Black Mass, and breaking out our scrying üÖ±Ô∏èones.\
Grab your crucifix, lead out your thiccest goat, and watch now as the band returns to full power by playing Uptown Goat.

:sd[Band forms A KNIFE (no!) and plays Uptown Girl]

Since your goat roast got canceled, we came up with a few new and improved festivals for you:

:::script-list

- A. Primal Scream, but with donuts - maybe call it the naked donut run?
- B. Pro-goat performance art
- C. Goat poop coffee tasting - trust us, look it up
- D. Literally anything that doesn‚Äôt involve goats, you freaks
- E. Sitting quietly and thinking about what you‚Äôve done and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch as the band goats a roast and plays Burn Me Up, Buttercup

:sd[Band forms the fire emoji and plays Build Me Up, Buttercup.]

Speaking of roasting, we thought we‚Äôd \~heat things up\~ a bit for you folks.\
How many Harvard students does it take to screw in a lightbulb?\
Just one: they hold the bulb up and wait for the world to revolve around them.\
How can you know if someone went to Harvard?\
Don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll tell you.\
‚ÄúNerds. 2 stars.‚Äù\
Watch now as the band gets ready for dinner and plays Bring the Roasts.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Bring the Victory]

Boom. Roasted. Brown Band Out.
