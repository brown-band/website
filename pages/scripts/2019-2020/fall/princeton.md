## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that swears it left its bike right here, it’s the Brown University “U Lock or U Lose (eh?)” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hello everyone. We now have a message from a close...friend, and we’d love for you to listen closely so that we can-

_Alright let’s cut to the chase. That’s a nice bike you have there Princeton, ‘d be a real shame sumthin’ happn’d to it. I’ve been hearing many things about this “Bait Bike” project you’ve cooked up, and our first reaction is good, good. Really, I’m impressed. Keeping real criminals out of the game with a clever trick like that, it’s like the heat is plastered right on the back of your neck. Or, so I imagine, that’s what it could be like. Just an idea of course. But why don’t you get back to your little game, and I’ll get back to Raymond Patriarca’s Coin-O-Matic._

Uh, watch now as the band cleans up this one-horse town and confronts the Lock Mobster.

We have to say, though, you’re doing your best to combat crime on campus, especially with your eternally binding honor code agreement. After all, if you commit any crime, Princeton should know about it. That’s not creepy at all, and it certainly doesn’t imply that you’re covering up for the Zodiac Killer, who was class of ‘92. Or a multi-billionaire CEO who doesn’t pay his taxes, class of ‘86. And definitely not a large body of higher education that stole manuscripts from a monastery in Kormista, Greece back in 1942 and still won’t give them back. That honor code is certainly doing wonders for the University’s image!

Watch now as the band takes notes at the dinner table and plays Snitching Forevermore.

Catch us at halftime when the heat gets even hotter.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s not sure if it’s hot in here or if it’s just us, it’s the Brown University ”stop drop and roll” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey Princeton, we were checking out your admissions site and were a little surprised to find that a full thirty percent of your legacy applicants get admitted, compared to only 7 percent of everyone else. Good thing rampant nepotism is a recent development in the Ivy League (ha), or you may have never admitted one of your most famous alumni: John F Kennedy. Although how could you turn him down, with the same personal statement that got him into Harvard?! (If you don’t remember how it goes, look it up and give it a reread- you can probably get through all 90 words in a couple nights!) We’re not saying that you’re a second choice school, Princeton; more like an acquired taste. In the words of JFK: to be a “Harvard Man” - I mean “Princeton Man”- is an enviable distinction indeed. Watch now as the band honors Princeton’s most open-minded alum and plays The Nation Wants You Back.

:sd[Band forms MY MIND (gotta study for neuro) and plays I Want You Back.]

Speaking of nepotism, eating clubs with their own personal bouncers, and other symptoms of silver spoon affluenza, we heard that all you Princeton folk are very protective of your school’s color -- apparently it “embodies the intensity of red and the levity of yellow”? Yeesh. Just wear brown like all the rest of us, why don’t you? I mean, look at all the things that are also Princeton Orange:

:::script-list

- A. Traffic cones
- B. Prison jumpsuits
- C. Garfield the Cat
- D. Clockwork
- E. Rudy Giuliani’s fingernails every saturday night and
- F. The Princeton band

Pull on your hazmat suit, give the President a spray tan, and watch now as the band plays More Than Just Orange.

:sd[Band forms an apple and plays More Than a Feeling.]

And now for Brown Band Safety Strategies Volume 66, Issue 6. DO NOT PLAY WITH MATCHES. Princeton, in April you had 4 arson cases in 4 days. Unacceptable. Considering 3 of those were in bathrooms, we have to wonder, are your chicken sandwiches just spicier than ours? We don’t really mind the heat, but it smells like ash in here, so if your nanny has never let you cook before, you should get out of the kitchen.\
Watch now as the Band “embodies the intensity of red and the levity of yellow” and plays Brown Burning Song.

And yeah, we know it’s family weekend, but since our parents are older than us, we didn’t know how to make any allowable jokes. Brown Band Out.
