Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting the only campus extra-curricular activity that looks _bad_ on your resume, it's the Brown University, "Let's keep our faculties about us" Band!

:sd[Band skates out into two circles. One all-male, the other all-female]

The Band is proud to welcome back the Hockey Team from their trip to China. We were sorry to have missed the opportunity to accompany them to a Communist Nation, but Brown made it up to us last weekend when they sent us to Massachusetts. We are happy to note that, like China, the United States is also undergoing a Cultural Revolution. Following in the footsteps of the bold innovators of Madison Avenue, the band pays tribute to the McDLT - whose unique package design keeps the hot hot :sd[Men clap once], the cold cold :sd[Women clap once], and the whole damn thing lukewarm. Clap your hands and join us as we build our own McDLT while playing "Hot Stuff."

:sd[Play "Hot Stuff." The two halves of the McDLT come together. I leave it to you to decide which side is the Hot Meat, and which is the cold lettuce and tomatoe. (Oh no! That's rude and sexist, and it's OUT!!). After song, skate into Dollar Sign]

In other political news, the Band notes that Brown sent UCS officers to the Philippines to oversee Thursday's Presidential Elections. The results speak for themselves. Elsewhere, as Brown's tuition approaches its Quantum Limit, the Band has learned of the Swearer/Sheridan/Glicksman Regime's plan to model Brown's finances after the Federal Budget under Gramm-Rudman. Security will get $220 Million for defense of the Green. The Housing Office will be turned over to the Private Sector, and funds for Social Dorm Programs will be drastically cut. The current proposed staffing plan, however, will remain unchanged. We now salute the fiscal conservatism of Howie, the Budgetary Knife.

:sd[Play "Mack The Knife." Dollar sign changes to Cents sign. Do a counterskate to a Brown song, into a large 'B'.]

Stay in your seats for the start of the second game of tonight's Hockey Double Header, when the Pandas take on the Soviet Men's Olympic Hockey Team (and win!).
