Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, now conducting purely routine training maneuvers, it's the Brown University, "How many votes can you stuff into a Manila envelope?" Band!

Brown University - home of the Limousine Liberal Arts - is always looking for ways to provide its students with a more Diverse education. The Band has learned of an Administration proposal to merge such popular Brown courses as Anger, Deviant Behavior, Racism, and Poverty into the newly formed Department of Inhumanities. Upcoming courses include Social Intolerance, and Applied Bigotry; as well as a new interdisciplinary concentration program for the S.D.I. degree in Math-Semiotics. Frankly, however, the Band prefers to stick with its previously declared concentration, the BYOB program. We now form a bottle of our favorite liquid refreshment, over ice, and play Everything's Coming Up Rose.

The Band realizes that it is hard to pay attention to a Hockey Game when you've just learned that you have Avogadro's Housing Lottery Number. Still, the world of sports is able, on occasion, to provide a distraction from the Diet Imitation Processed Cheese Food Product sitting on your VW Burger. As you may know, scandal recently ripped through the sporting world when the Boston Globe revealed that the Brown Band failed to pass voluntary drug tests when traces of Blood were found in its Alcohol. The Band now salutes our favorite magazine issue of the year by forming a one-piece bathing suit while playing The Wide, Wide World of Sports Illustrated.

As you leave tonight, please don't forget to sign our petition for a microwave-free-zone in the Ratty. In the words of Heating Engineer Archibald Tuttle, "We're all in this together."

:sd[Counterskate to Number Three in the 'B,' bow, and skate off the ice. Crowd wakes up and goes home. Peter Sultan gives up show-writing for lent.]

NOTE: Show not done due to lack of Bandies on ice.
