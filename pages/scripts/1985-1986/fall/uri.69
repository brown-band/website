<em>Hurricane Gloria Spectacular</em>
</sp>
<sp>
Good afternoon Bruin Fans, and welcome to Brown Stadium. We would like to remind all interested students that there will be an open
 forum concerning Brown's Fraternity System tonight at 2 AM outside President Swearer's house. A keg will not be provided. Ladies
 and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting the only Band to have been officially declared a Federal Disaster Area even before
 the hurricane, it's the Brown University, "Hey, even Cliffe couldn't manage a two-point conversion" Band!
 </sp>

 <sp>
<sd>Band runs madly out into the International symbol for a Hurricane and remains in it for the next two formations</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
The Band is happy to be back at Brown after a long summer and is relieved to find that some students have remained
politically active. In fact, one group is currently planning a massive Protest (Bake Sale) against the upcoming screening
of "Star Wars." In response, the President's office recapitulated Howie's Summer Edict: Relax, Don't Do It. But not all
 students are so concerned. The present student body at Brown seems to be more interested in charge accounts than in
 computer accounts, and while the popularity of the John Hay Society has declined, enrollment is up in the newly
 formed conservative group, the Baby Seal Club. To today's trendy freshmen, B and H is still only a cigarette, and
 GCB means Great Sale at Benetton's. Yeah, they can't spell either. The Band now salutes this breezy new breed
 of first year student, which is taking Brown by storm.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Play "Hot Stuff" and remain in formation</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Unlike our formation, Brown's campus underwent physical changes during the summer. Returning upper-classmen have
noticed that in its efforts to expose the student body to "Cultcha," Brown has acquired yet another in its series
of "What the Hell is this?" sculptures. The Band now tires to answer the question on everyone's mind, "One and a Half What?!" Is It:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A.	The yearly rate at which Brown is divesting itself of Fraternities.</sli>
<sli>B.	The number of required courses for an O.B. Major?</sli>
<sli>C.	The number of electives an Engin major can take in four years?</sli>
<sli>D.	The number of frisbee dogs that vanish from the Green the week before the Ratty serves Shepherd's Pie?</sli>
<sli>E.	The average hourly wage of an Am-Civ concentrator after graduation, or </sli>
<sli>F.	The Princeton Band?</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Actually the answer is G: The cumulative GPA of the Brown Band after football season. We now contemplate the
stainless-steel swiss cheese in front of the Sci-Li, but refuse to form it because we're still blown away by Gloria.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Play "Joshua." After song, run madly into a giant Beer Can</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Turning from High Winds to Low Spirits, the Band salutes Brown's new Drinking Policy by not reforming a keg
on the field and plays "Can-Can."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Play "Can-Can"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
The Brown Band is entirely fictitious, and bears no resemblance to anything, whatsoever.

<em>
Program Notes: This show was the result of massive first quarter re-writing in the stands due to the
interference of Hurricane Gloria which prevented us from rehearsing the original show formations and songs
(which is just as well since they weren;t looking and sounding too great at Thursday marching rehearsal).
Also, the previous game at Yale was lost when we failed at a two-point conversion in the last minute. This
was also the show when the Studium Announcer introduced us before the National Anthem as being under the
Direction of Walt McGarrell. And so a legend was born. Cliffe was the Evangelist on the Green. Jerry Mathers was the Beaver.
