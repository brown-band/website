_Brown Band vs. University of Michigan Band -- Live on the Green from NBC's Today Show_

:sd[Close up of Announcer \[Voice, Rick Perera\]]

Good Morning America! It's the Brown University "We'll teach you to put us on live television" Band!

:sd[Band runs out madly at word 'University' into concert formation]

The Band asked for Sixty Minutes on Sunday night, but only got one and a half on Thursday morning.\
 Not being sure if we could form a Peacock on the air, we decided to form only half. We now enter a green Pea formation to salute the Ivy League and play "The Magnificent Seven" plus Cornell.

:sd[Band starts to play Mag 7, but loses its sound after intro]

Please do not adjust your set

:sd[Suddenly Band regains sound for 2 bars, then loses it again]

The Band is experiencing technical difficulties, please stand by.

:sd[Band regains sound for last bars of piece, then runs madly about Green, and back into concert formation]

We're happy to learn about Michigan Tech, but who is this Ann Arbor anyway?\
 Brown is in Rhode Island, a state with more people per square mile than Michigan, but their population is denser.\
 The Band now salutes the Renaissance Men :sd[Band shouts AND WOMEN!] of Brown who are experiencing a classical education, while their parents are going Baroque.

:sd[Band plays Toccatto from L'Orfeo, arr. McGarrell. As song ends, large sign is held up: US OUT OF R.I.]

Back to you, Ted.

:sd[Band yell out: YOU'LL LOVE IT!]

:sd[For encore, play 'Ever True.' Jane Pauley is overwhelmed]
