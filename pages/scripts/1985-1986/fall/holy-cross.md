## Halftime

In the beginning, the Earth was void, and without form. A group of creatures crawled forth from the primordial soup, gradually learned to walk erect, and then stopped evolving. Throughout the eons they have been called the Missing Link, the Abominable Snowmen, bigfoot, and Dartmouth Coeds. Today we know them all too well as the Brown University, "Where does stained glass come from anyway?" Band!

:sd[Band runs out from sidelines to stormy applause and runs madly into a large circle, with a tuba in the middle]

The Band has heard that the College of Holy Cross will soon become a full-fledged University after the opening of a new institution of learning: The Vatican School of Business Administration – Visa and Mastercard accepted. Enroll and become a charter member of the Monk of the Month Club. October's selection includes Rasputin, Mendel, Art, Thelonious and Alvin. He, of course, was a chipmunk. The Band was saddened last year when it learned that Alvin met an untimely death in a bizzare shuffleboard accident after he ran away with Gopher from the Love Boat. In his Memory, the Band forms a Habitrail racewheel on the field, and plays Alvin's Pushing Up Roses.

:sd[Band plays "Everything's Coming Up Roses," as the wheel spins around the tuba. After song, run into 666 – just kidding – run into a simple model of an animal cell]

The Band has travelled excommunicado here today to try to add a little spice to the otherwise grey, dreary existences of Holy Cross students, who are only now feeling a little excitement at the prospect of the St Louis College of Cardinals ruling over Royalty at last, in Missoura'. But such thrills are transitory at best here in Worcester, Mass. where the only sanctioned social activity is cell mitosis. The Band now forms a dividing cell on the field to symbolize the high point of a Holy Cross student's big night out, while playing Dancing, JUST Dancing, In The Dark.

:sd[Play "Dancing In The Dark," as the cell divides. Bruce Springsteen sues for mutilation of his music by Bill Moffit. Trombones run around St. Peter's as white doves fly around the flute section, and white puffs of smoke come out of Darlene's tuba. Meanwhile the Band has run into a concert formation]

We're sure that by now you're all anxious for the Band to leave, so we'll just take this opportunity to tune up before our final song. Ok, Band, give me a concert B flat.

:sd[Band plays 30 seconds of dischord – what we do best, actually]

I think the E flat Clarinets were a little sharp there. Can we try that once again, please.

:sd[More musical conumdrums. Crowd is hurling holy water at Jose]

That's fine. Be back in two years to watch the Brown Band say "In Deo Speramus" to a nun. But stay tuned now as the Holy Cross Band teaches you the true meaning of suffering.

:sd[March off on yardlines to "Ever True."]

This week's Button: LACK OF VIRGIN (HEY!)

:script-note[John Parry censored the original version of this show beyond recognition, and a makeshift show had to be reconstructed hastily before Tuesday night rehearsal by Sultan, Dougan and Co. For reference: The St Louis Cardinals were playing the Kansas City Royals in the World Series as this show was performed. KC won, I believe.]
