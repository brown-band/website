Joan, Can we talk? Good afternoon, Quaker fans, and welcome again to U. Penn. One of our nation's Universities. Before halftime begins we would like to ask you to search around underneath your seats. If you find a large greasy wad of old purple chewing gum stuck there, you are the winner of this week's football lottery. Your prize, a one-way bus ticket to State College, may be claimed at the corner of 48th and Market anytime after midnight. Ladies and Gentlemen, Penns and Alumni, get ready to MOVE over, because here comes the Brown University, "Yeah, well we think you're Boring too!" Band!
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band runs out madly onto field, throwing incendiary bombs into the crowd. Run into an outline of a House. Just as Band runs into formation, everyone shakes their left leg out a few times, just as the Penn Band does</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
While the Brown Band is always happy to perform at non-conference games, like this one, we did have some reservations about road-tripping down to Pennsylvania. Rumor has it that our seasonal presence at Ben Franklin Stadium evokes a class of feelings in Penn students, none of which can easily be classified as Brotherly Love. Frankly, the Band is mystified by this reaction. Look, we aren't the Brown Admissions Office. It's not our fault you wound up here. Try to take your mind off of it. Relax. Go to a movie. We saw a great one last night, " The Goode, The Bad, and the Ugly," about the Mayor of Philadelphia, Leroy Brown, and the Penn Campus. Moving from things unsightly to things no longer there, the Band now salutes Philadelphia's innovative method of Urban Renewal as we MOVE on down the road and "Keep The Home Fires Burning."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Play "Keep The Home Fires Burning," as the House outline slowly collapses. Ling orange and red banners are used as flames. After song, Band is universally condemned by all civilized peoples, and runs into a Bell Curve – a nice Gaussian Distribution. And shake those legs out again</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
After truly Burning Down The House, the Band is reminded of another Talking Heads tune inspired by Penn students: The Road To Nowhere. In truth, however, we are glad that U. Penn is around to lend dignity to the phrase "Diploma Mill." Look at it this way, you're not the worst school in the Ivy League. You're way ahead of whoever's in ninth place. We're also glad to hear that Pennsylvania's meager endowment is finally beginning to expand – especially after that benefit concert this summer: Live-Aid Mania. We are not The World, but an incredible simulation. But hold on. With Brown's endowment in the shape it's in, we have nothing to laugh about. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw firebombs, after all. Watch now as the Band symbolizes the infamous mediocrity of U. Penn by forming the middle of a Bell curve on the field, as we recognize the only kind of student you can find at Penn: "Everyday People."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Play "Everyday People." Waves of hatred can be felt pouring out of the Penn side of the stands. The show-writer is glad he wasn't at the game. After fans have ceased venting their spleens, run into the letters GRE – the reason the show-writer wasn't at the game. Do one final leg shake as the Band runs into formation</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Stop shaking your leg, Band. You should have thought of that before the show! In a serious note, we would like to extend our sympathies to those absent friends currently undergoing the academic blood-letting known as the Graduate Record Exam. But you synthetic Bohemians wouldn't know anything about the Pre-Professional rat race, would you? The Band wonders what significance the letters GRE carry for Penn students. Could they stand for:<sbr/>
	Grades in Remedial English<sbr/>
	Greatest Ripoff in Education <sbr/>
Garbage Reported Everywhere<sbr/>
Greed Rising Exponentially<sbr/>
   Or, a Good Reason to Evacuate<sbr/>
The Band now predicts what most senior IBM hopefuls will do when they open their test result envelopes in six weeks and find the scores telling them: Hey, You'd better Take Me Over.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Play "Hey, Look Me Over." GRE changes to CRY. Even Mother Teresa is now hurling invectives at us – and we all know how painful that can be</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Next on the field, the Penn Band fertilizes the Astroturf. Please move quickly and in an orderly manner to the nearest exit.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>March off on yardlines to "Ever True."</sd>

This Week's Button: BEARS EAT OATS

Program Notes: As is evident, this was the strongest (an nastiest) show of the year. For it, we got a love letter in the BDH from Miss Cathy Day '87 – See Robert Reichley for details. Some notes on the show itself: Joan Rivers sat next to the Band for part of the first quarter. State College, PA is where Penn State is. 48th and Market is the sleaze-pit of Pennsylvania (Kind of like Pine St. in Providence, or 217 Ives). MOVE was the radical group that Mayor Goode ordered fire-bombed, thus destroying an entire neighborhood in Philly. The GRE's were indeed on the Saturday of the game. (I did OK, in case you were wondering)
