## Halftime

:sd[Since the Cornell Band didn't show up for the game, we figured we would supply one for them. Around 15 Bandies, dressed in red Cornell Band t-shirts, and Cornell sweatshirts with white pants marched into the visitor's stands midway through the 2nd quarter. Led by ex-Drum-Major and then-President Jose "Iron-Wrist" Zorola, the micro-band played the High-School Cheer 20-30 times, was cheered by Cornell fans, and played "Give My Regards To Ezra" as the team ran off. At the start of half-time, the Cornell Band took the field...]

:sd[Female voice – Sheila Clifford – in an obnoxious L.I. nasal accent – takes the microphone as the Band marches onto the field to a drum cadence]

The Cornell Band welcomes you to the Brown University Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, where we hear that the admissions office has already spoken with Charles and Di about getting Prince William for enrollment here in the fall. But we shouldn't JUMP to conclusions. If we're not careful you'll place us under suicide arrest. Cornell U. salutes all you wanna-be radicals from Westchester by forming a cyanide circle of solidarity on the field as we borrow Daddy's Gold American Express Card and play "Charge!"

:sd[The Cornell Band forms a circle on the 30-yard line, and the trumpets play "Charge," at which point the rest of the Brown Band runs out from the bushes, grabs the Cornell Band, and pulls it off the field after beating it profusely about the face and neck. One Cornell Bandie – Sara Zucker – lies dead on the field for the remainder of the show. Another – Ben Hall is bloody and wounded, and tries to drag himself off the field, but is constantly assaulted by the trombones between songs, who kick and trample him some more. The regular Voice resumes]

We're sure you'll all agree that you can carry the concept of allowing the free expression of differing ideas just so far. But now, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Freshmen mothers and fathers – and their parents – it's the Brown University "I'm no prude, but there are some things that should simply be" Band!

:sd[The real Band now runs out onto the field, joined later by the micro-Cornell-Band who change sweaters behind the bushes. Run into an Horizon Formation – i.e. a straight line]

As you may recall from our last episode, when we left our hero, Buckaroo Bandzai, trying to save the universe from total destruction at the hands of the evil Emperor Zolton from the planet Prego, he died – Bummer. But on to happier things. You parents may not be able to tell this by mere conversation, by the Band has replaced your children today with Spam Luncheon Meat. Spam. The miracle food of the 70's. Now available in the new non-aerosol pump. But onto something incredibly vile: Freshman Parents...aren't getting the respect they deserve. The Band would like to apologize for this completely unqualified statement by presenting Bruno's proud progenitors with a sunny day.

:sd[Play "Let The Sunshine In," as the sun rises slowly over the horizon. An EMT has rushed out onto the field to see if Sara is really dead. Brave trooper that she is, Sara waves him away. After song, run into crescent moon – it's NOT a Banana!!]

Sensitive to the grumblings of numerous Brown interest groups, the Band is aware that many Alumni have complained that Brown's present student body is filled with lesser students: radicals, hippies, Democrats. While at the same time parents insist that the diverse flavor of their children brings to Brown a healthy curiosity, a bright atmosphere, and good taste. There you have it: Parents say 'Tastes Great,' Alumni say 'Less Filling.' The Band refuses to enter into this horrible cliché, and instead reminds parents that the man sitting next to you wearing that silly hat is your son in 20 years; and we also caution Alumni that without Daddy's and their checkbooks, Brown itself would be impossible. In recognition of this the Band would like to present the Alumni with a moonlit evening, as we play "Blues In The Night."

:sd[Play "Blues In The Night." Ben has crawled in great pain over to Matt and pleadingly asks for medical assistance. Matt beings to help Ben to his feet, but thinks better of it, and throws him back to the ground and kicks him in the head. Meanwhile the Band has run into the Brown Colgate...I'm sorry: Crest. Against the Show-Writer's wishes, the cardboard books are used.]

Wait a minute! A sunny day? A moonlit evening? Whence such sentimentality? Could this be the same Brown Band permanently barred from performing at West Point – the 5th best High School in Orange County, New York? The same Brown Band who seriously considered showing Jane Pauley a second meaning for the phrase, 'Lunar Eclipse' on national television? Or could it be...The Cornell Band in disguise. Nope. No Cow-Chips on the turf. In a serious note, the Band does its best to form the Brown Crest on the field to thank Students, Parents, and Alumni alike for their support as we salute all of us "Brown Men Born."

:sd[Play "Brown Man Born"]

Be in Worcester next week to watch Holy Cross-anwich try to beat the stuffin' out of us.

:sd[March off on yardlines to 'Ever True']

This Week's Button: THIS CUD'S FOR YOU

_Program Notes: Not much more needs to be added to the above commentary. However, it should be noted that the Brown crowd did believe the micro-band to be the actual Cornell Band, and greeted it's initial appearance on the field with massive cheers of Boring! Boring! etc._
