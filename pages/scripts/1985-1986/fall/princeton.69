Just imagine. It might not be too far in the future before members of the Princeton Band gain positions of power, and start making administrative and military decisions that could effect your lives. There are few thoughts more frightening than this. Or are there? Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting the only campus organization to have broken 9 out of 10 commandments during one halftime show, it's the Brown University, "If you don't feel guilty, it wasn't that good. Right, Lisa?" Band!

After a long season trapped in a PBS timeslot between Jaqueus Cousteau and Brideshead Revisited, the Band is glad to be moving up to real TV. No, not cable. We said real TV, not good TV. When the Main Green finally appears on network television without the presence of rabid campus unrest, many questions will be posed: Why are all these cameras here? We haven't done anything. Have We? But then again, neither has the Administration. Is Brown losing its image of being a haven for Doonesbury stereotypes, or will school malcontents be shielded from the public eye by the Jane Pauley Exclusion Principle? We'll have to see. It's just like what we told Ted Koppel what Dan Rather heard from Mike Wallace about Peter Jennings and Hugh Downs on the Good Morning America Nightline show: Such an appearance might not expose Bruno's best side, but we'll take what we an get, even though the show we'd rather be on is Tonight.

Elsewhere in the media world we find that Natural Disasters are all the rage, with extensive network coverage of such catastrophes as storms, plagues, famine, recorded NC's and the Columbia Football Team. Closer to our hearts are the recent attacks on the music industry, as gaggles of Senator's wives lobby for child-proof jackets on Rock albums. Luckily the only Senate measure yet passed was a Federal injunction declaring that Barry Manilow does not write the songs the whole world sings. Speaking for itself, the Band decries any use of subliminal sexual messages to boost record sales. As an example, here's a cut from our latest band album, "Screaming Fists of the Anti-Christ."

But wait! Play that one backward at slow speed.

Turning from mass media, to an inert mass, the Band now considers some of the problems facing the only school that truly deserves to be in New Jersey. It seems that Princeton's Institute of Advanced Study has come under some intense moral scrutiny after its recent public lecture and film series on the Two-Body Interaction. Princeton Profs were warned that they too might get warning labels on their jackets if they continued to discuss such concepts as Thrust, Acceleration, Friction Coefficients, Fluid Dynamics, or Excited States without their corresponding Biblical interpretations. A spokesman reported that a recent seminar on Gravitation was heavy stuff indeed. Watch now as the Band violates Section 305 of the Tariff Act of 1930, by representing a potentially immoral physical reaction on the field, while playing The Classical Gas Equation.

Be back in two weeks, when we'll really gie the Alumni something to write Brown about.

Program notes: 'Lisa' is, of course, Lisa Cohen. You can ask her about that night with the Scrabble Club, only don't tell Joe.
