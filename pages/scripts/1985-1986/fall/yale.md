## Halftime

Federal Regulations requires us to warm those members of the audience with pacemakers, hearing aids, digital watches, or small and impressionable children that they may wish to leave the area immediately. Ladies and Gentleman, Friends and Alumni, presenting the real reason A. Bartlett Giamatti is leaving Tale, it's the Brown University, "Are you sure we can say 'Cherry Coke' on the field?" Band!

:sd[Band runs madly onto the field from the bushes, and quickly forms an envelope, complete with address and stamp \[an American Flag\]]

The Brown Band is proud to be here today to open the '85 Ivy Football Season, and to commemorate Yale University's 284th academic year â€“ you know that's 853 to you and me. We now try to make up for the fact that People Magazine won't be at Yale much this year, having moved it's New England Bureau to Providence. We salute the most prestigious position currently held by a Tale Alumnus and form a First Class letter on the field. Watch as our own Miami Vice-President George 'Anhauser' Bush performs his most important function and brings Mail To The Chief.

:sd[Band Plays "Hail to the Chief" as the letter moves across the field. After song, Band runs into arm and fist formation.]

But wait! What was in that envelope? Why, it's a letter from the Reverend Falwell: Dear Ron, Having a wonderful time here in Pretoria, laying wreaths and handing out investment advice. I heard you proposed sending Johnny Rambo to South Africa to re-fight the American Civil War, only "heh, heh, we get to win this time!" Too bad he's gone back to being a boxer again. We could have used him in Beirut. Stay out of the sun, Regards, Jerry. Watch now as the Band forms Rambo's bulging bicep on the field and beefs up American Foreign Policy while playing The Fanfare to Rocky IV: Second Blood Part Three, The Prequel.

:sd[Band Plays "Rocky Fanfare," as the arm muscle bulges obscenely outward. Band next runs into a giant colon]

Well Band, I guess that's enough muscle flexing for today. However working out out by itself isn't enough, folks. It's important to take care to the insides as well as the outsides. The Brown Band makes sure to eat a healthy diet of whole grains, like rice, barley malt and hops; and we always eat a good breakfast to obtain the majority of out moral fiber requirement. Are you enough for Grape Nuts? The Band is. But remember, going off this diet can have serious ramifications. A recent Government probe revealed such trouble deep within the bowels of Washington, requiring an immediate purge to rectify the situation. Watch now as the Brown Band demonstrates the procedure to relieve this problem as recommended by Band surgeon Mad Max The Knife.

:sd[Band plays " Mack the Knife" as the colon changes into a semi-colon.]

Transcripts of today's half-time show will be delivered to your home unless you send two dollars to The Brown Band Prevention Fund, Box 1930, Providence, Rhode Island.\
:sd[March off to 'Ever True' and to tumultuous applause]

Band Button for this game: STIKE AT YALE
