<em>Brown Band vs. University of Michigan Band -- Live on the Green from NBC's Today Show</em>
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Close up of Announcer [Voice, Rick Perera] </sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Good Morning America! It's the Brown University "We'll teach you to put us on live television" Band!
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band runs out madly at word 'University' into concert formation</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
The Band asked for Sixty Minutes on Sunday night, but only got one and a half on Thursday morning.<sbr/>
Not being sure if we could form a Peacock on the air, we decided to form only half. We now enter a green Pea formation to salute the Ivy League and play "The Magnificent Seven" plus Cornell.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band starts to play Mag 7, but loses its sound after intro</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Please do not adjust your set
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Suddenly Band regains sound for 2 bars, then loses it again</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
The Band is experiencing technical difficulties, please stand by.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band regains sound for last bars of piece, then runs madly about Green, and back into concert formation</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
We're happy to learn about Michigan Tech, but who is this Ann Arbor anyway?<sbr/>
Brown is in Rhode Island, a state with more people per square mile than Michigan, but their population is denser.<sbr/>
The Band now salutes the Renaissance Men <sd>Band shouts AND WOMEN!</sd> of Brown who are experiencing a classical education, while their parents are going Baroque.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band plays Toccatto from L'Orfeo, arr. McGarrell. As song ends, large sign is held up: US OUT OF R.I.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Back to you, Ted.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band yell out: YOU'LL LOVE IT!</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>For encore, play 'Ever True.' Jane Pauley is overwhelmed</sd><sbr/>
