:sd[Band gathers at edge of ice and shivers in anticipation, or maybe it’s just the cold]

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has been shown to cause hypochondria in lab rats, it’s the Brown University “nighttime sniffling sneezing coughing aching stuffy head fever so you can rest” Band!

:sd[Band storms rink]

Guess what boys and girls? It’s housing lottery time again! As a public service the band would like to answer the ten questions most frequently asked about the housing lottery:

:::script-list

- #10) Is the Grad Center really bad as everyone says?
- #9) If I live in Social Dorm does that mean I have to join the ISO?
- #8) Is housing lottery anything like that short story “The Lottery” where they pick someone’s name out of a hat and throw stones at them?
- #7) Is the Brown Band show writer single?
- #6) Isn’t squatting illegal in Rhode Island?
- #5) If I live in a Greek House does that mean I have to speak Greek?
- #4) If my number is bad enough will I end up in a janitor’s closet?
- #3) Are janitor’s closets networked?
- #2) Is the Grad Center really all that bad?
- #1) I’m a CS major, I live in the CIT, can I just skip this housing lottery thing?

:::

And the answers, in no particular order, are:

- I remember that story, I read it in sixth grade
- No, but you get free toilet paper
- Yes
- No way
- Really! It was designed by the same guy who did the Providence Jail
- No, but it is in South Carolina
- Maybe
- No, but you might end up living in the basement of the Ratty
- You must be joking!
- And, Yes, funny you should ask, he is available. His phone number is 863-- What? I’m just reading what it says in the script here. OK, OK...

Watch now as the band forms the most important element of the housing lottery -- pure luck -- and plays “Everybody Needs Somewhere to Live”

:sd[Band forms pure luck (an arch, which decays into a quantum electron cloud of God playing dice with swirling bandies) and plays “Everybody Needs Somebody” (Familiar? Naaah, this is NOTHING like last week’s show!)]

Elrod and his friends -- who just happen to be named after characters from really bad eighties sit-coms -- are rising juniors eager to get out of the Graduate Center. They enter the segment one lottery as a group, hoping to get a Young O. Apartment. Unfortunately, they soon realize that their numbers aren’t good enough to get them a storage closet in the basement. Instead, they decide to go for a New Dorm suite.

Even though their copies of Grapevine don’t arrive until two weeks after the lottery, they realize the importance of getting there on time and decide to go for coffee. Elrod and Balki want to go to Starbucks, but Booger -- the janitor from Good Times -- wants Au Bon Pain, and Schneider -- the janitor from One Day At A Time -- prefers Cafe la France. Arguing over where to get coffee, they lose track of time and miss their turn. Instead, all those people who live in Herman’s head get their suite. Oh, the irony! If only they’d gone to Ocean for Depth-Charges they wouldn’t be living in a hole in the ground in the middle of Wriston.

Watch now as the band performs its salute to the Depth-Charge.

:sd[Band forms snazzy rotating X and plays “Brown Forevermore” at triple tempo (Familiar? OK, same songs... but we got different shapes this time!)]

Lady and gentleman, friend and alumnus, presenting an organism that has seen snow and hyperspace in lap dogs, it’s the clown universally “if you don’t look good, we don’t care” bland!

Faded equilibrium, fiends and apple pie, resenting disorganization fat green glow lipstick traces fab cats, it’s the get down eventually “nothing short of a miracle” hand!

Psychobabble, technobabble, trendybabble, A-yoo, A-vee, A-doubleyoo, Annex, X-chromosome, ex post facto, expatriate, tourniquet, survival kit, kit, baby fox, bagel with lox, picking locks, pickle socks. . .

:sd[Announcer taps microphone]

Excuse me, it seems we were having microphone problems again. Watch now as the band stretches the limits of its first amendment rights in protest of the Communications Decency Act and shouts fire in a crowded auditorium.

:sd[Band forms “B” (surprise!) and plays “Fire”]

We hope you’ve enjoyed our little play. Be on the lookout for more fun and educational special events with the Brown Band this Spring.
