:sd[Band assembles at edge of arena]

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, presenting an organization that promises not to make any toothpaste jokes, it’s the Brown University “Lonely Hearts” Band.

:sd[Band gracefully skates onto ice... hopefully]

The band would like to wish you all a belated happy Valentine’s Day. Yeah... it was last Wednesday in case you just didn’t notice. Did you get any chocolates? All I got was a rock.

While Valentine’s Day may be for the average Brown student what Labor Day is for the unemployed, at least it gives us a chance to find out just how much the Undergraduate Council of Students cares for us all. Why just look at their HUGS project, hitting us over the head with the fact that Brown students can’t socialize without government interference. And as if that weren’t nice enough of them, Time Magazine did a story on the project so now the entire country is convinced we’re losers.

The final insult came in the form of a form-- a computer dating form, that is. Of course, we all know that everybody just filled it out for a laugh. And of course anybody who buys a list is only doing it because he or she knows the money is going to financial aid.

The band did notice that the form was sadly deficient in its options, so we would like to present our revised version: Question #1. If you were a car, what would you be?\
A) A Hummer\
B) An Edsel\
C) A Jalopy\
D) A Lime-green Chevy Impala

2\. What is the facial feature you notice first on the opposite sex?\
A) Eyes\
B) Smile\
C) Nostril hair

3\. How important are clothes and appearance?\
A) Unimportant. What counts is personality, which is completely separate from these things.\
B) Gimme a break. Read your Kierkegaard! Appearance and clothing are manifestations of style. A person’s personality will inevitably change over time, but constancy of style avoids discontinuities in the temporal progression of the self.\
C) Clothes and appearance deal with a being’s projection onto the plane of reality, and thus are linked to matters of finitude. Personality, on the other hand, exists on the plane of the transcendent. Both are key elements, and to deny the importance of either is to indulge in what Jean-Paul Sartre called “Bad Faith.”

Watch now as the band forms existential angst and plays “Epistemology Forevermore.”

Question #4. When you’re walking down the street, do you smile at people?\
A) Yes\
B) Only if I know them\
C) No\
D) I glare at them malevolently due to my misanthropic nature

5\. Your feelings toward pets are:\
A) Love pets; would like at least two\
B) Like pets; one is enough\
C) No thanks; I’m a vegetarian

6\. If you had a chance to have your fortune told for free, what would you do?\
A) Decline because you think it’s nonsense\
B) Accept but not take it seriously\
C) Accept and heed the fortune teller’s words\
D) Suspect that it’s part of a government conspiracy, but I’m not gonna fall for it! They’re after my lucky charms aren’t they? NO! THEY’RE MAGICALLY DELICIOUS AND THEY’RE ALL MINE! Pink hearts! Yellow moons! Orange stars! Green clovers! Blue Diamonds!

:sd[Band yells “And purple horseshoes!”]

Forms should be deposited under the door of Fulton rehearsal hall. All answers will be kept confidential as long as your check doesn’t bounce. Here’s to good luck in finding love through technology, and even if you don’t trust computers you can just call up the two people listed as your least compatible. Maybe by next Valentine’s Day you’ll be singing along with the band.

:sd[Band forms obligatory “B,” plays “I Got You (I Feel Good)”]

Join us next Friday when Brown hockey takes on Saint Lawrence and the band attempts a triple axle.
