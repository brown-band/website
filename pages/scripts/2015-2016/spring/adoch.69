Well, today is a very special day. I'm sure you can all guess why. It's our favorite day of the year... ADOCH! You thought that was going to be a joke about today being April 20th, but weed are much too cool for that. Bet you didn't think weed go there, huh? Weed love for you to join Brown's class of 4/20<smdash/>I mean, 2020. You're just like our vision on most days, as long as we're wearing our glasses. As a "toke"n of congratulations for your acceptances into Brown, watch now as the band forms a "cereal bowl" and plays Red-Eyed Girl.
