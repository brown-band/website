Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is sneaking up behind you,
it's the Brown University "Boo!" BANNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
We bet you had no idea we were going to be playing a show on this field today, but here we are! Surprise!
We're so darn sneaky. In fact, we've been thinking a lot about what it means to be truly stealthy as
 preparation for this event. We think we've done a great job, since you definitely couldn't see us
 standing off to the side waiting to run onto the Main Green. We look to our heroes of stealth for
 guidance as we perform this stealth show. Here is a list of our favorite spies.

<sli>A) Harriet the <sd>pause</sd></sli>
<sli>B) Edward Snowden</sli>
<sli>C) Severus Snape</sli>
<sli>D) Bridge of <sd>pause</sd></sli>
<sli>E) Waldo (Seriously. Where is he?), and</sli>
<sli>F) THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

We're in the final stretch of the semester now! We have learned many things this year, including
some fascinating facts that we are going to share with you now. Did you know that the mitochondria
is the powerhouse of the cell? The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. That is the only
fact that we have learned this year. We have, however, learned some things that <em>aren't</em> facts,
like how to analyze philosophical texts and how to perform open heart surgery under pressure. So
if you need anyone for that, just give us a shout. Or if you need to know about mitochondria.
They're the powerhouse of the cell.

Watch now as the band forms a mitochondria and plays "Stacy's Momtochondria."

Tomorrow starts our favorite holiday, Spring Weekend! What other time of year can we kick back,
relax, and drink our body's weight in cheap booze? As a warning required of us by the state of
Rhode Island, drinking your weight in cheap booze will double your body weight and, at minimum,
double your chances of accidentally puking in front of that kid you were tryna f***. That's not
a good way to seal the deal. But seriously, be safe, kids! Use condoms, get tested for STDs, don't
do too many drugs, stay hydrated, and avoid the Port-A-Potty on the far left.

Watch now as the band forms a B and plays Brown Cheering Bong.

Goodbye, everyone. We hope you took our words to heart. Catch us at ADOCH if you happen to be an
accepted student. Otherwise, watch out for us at a location near you! Brown Band out.
