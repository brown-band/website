A long time ago in a band room far far away... BAND WARS! The Band's rhythm has vanished. In its absence, the sinister COLGATE HOCKEY TEAM has risen 
from the ashes of the ECAC and will not rest until the Brown Band, the last bastion of hope, has been destroyed. With the support of the other IVY BANDS, 
General Elrod Snidley leads a brave RESISTANCE. He is desperate to reinvigorate the Band's rhythm and use it to restore bold music and groove to the galaxy. 
Elrod has sent the entire Band on a secret mission into Meehan, where with their skates and instruments, they've discovered a way to recover their rhythm...

Good news, everyone! We've conquered space, the final frontier. We have found strange new worlds and boldly gone where no man or woman has gone before. 
Where we went, we didn't need roads. We found the restaurant at the end of the universe. We journeyed to the center of the earth. We have explored all of 
time and space, everything that ever happened or ever will, and found that the hottest spot in the galaxy is on this ice. Watch now as the Band hits 88 
beats per minute and goes Back to the Future.

Time for us to climb back into the Millennium Falcon and go blow up the Death Star or whatever. Catch us next Friday at the men's hockey game vs. Clarkson. 
Live long and prosper. Brown Band out. May the force be with you. Brown Band out again. To infinity and beyond! Okay, we're really out this time. Bye-fi. 
Game over, man.
