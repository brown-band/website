Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's back in Providence, it's the Brown University 
"we hope that we've been missed" BANNNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
Surprise, we're alive. It's been a long winter. No it hasn't, thanks global warming. Last year, we came back to nice weather 
and then the sky regretted its mistake and gave us four feet of snow. This year, we came back to a snowstorm and now it's springtime. 
Weather, amirite? What a wacky phenomenon. Watch now as the band sleeps with a spoon under our pillow and plays We Want Snow Back.

We're so glad that last week's massive unloading of snow on the east coast did not stop our treasured alumni from making the trek 
back to dear old Providence. Here are a list of other famous treks that our alumni have made just for the Brown Band:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Through the Khyber Pass between Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Hindu Kush.</sli>
<sli>B. To the liquor store, since a majority of the Band is not 21. (Just kidding, they would <sd>never</sd> do that.)</sli>
<sli>C. The Kessel Run, in fourteen - I mean twelve-parsecs</sli>
<sli>D. Star-get it? LIKE STAR TREK!</sli>
<sli>E. Bus ride to the beautiful city of Ithaca, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band!</sli>
</sul>

Watch now as the Band forms a plane and plays a trek through fire and flames.

Here is a paragraph. It is a nice paragraph. It has feeling and emotion. It probably also has some jokes. They are probably sexual! 
This is the part where you laugh. <sd>long pause</sd> Thank you. Wow, we are spectacular. They don't call us the funniest band in the Ivy 
League for nothing. (...they don't call us that.) Let's tell a joke. What's the only difference between a piano and glue? <sd>long pause</sd>
You can tune a piano, but you can't tune a fish! <sd>long pause</sd> Oh, are you all stuck on the part about glue? Thank you. Thank you. 
Thank you. Please give it up for the Brown University Band.

That's all for us tonight-hope you've enjoyed our show as much as we've enjoyed the loving embraces of our alumni (we missed you!). 
Catch us next Friday at the women's basketball game against Harvard! Brown Band out.
