Ladies and gentlemen, future friends and even-more-in-the-future alumni, presenting an organization that wants you (sexually), it’s the Brown University “_come_ join the band (wink wink)!!! BANDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, today is a very special day. I’m sure you can all guess why. It’s our favorite day of the year... ADOCH! You thought that was going to be a joke about today being April 20th, but weed are much too cool for that. Bet you didn’t think weed go there, huh? Weed love for you to join Brown’s class of 4/20—I mean, 2020. You’re just like our vision on most days, as long as we’re wearing our glasses. As a “toke”n of congratulations for your acceptances into Brown, watch now as the band forms a “cereal bowl” and plays Red-Eyed Girl.

In the last few weeks, well-meaning friends and relatives may have gotten confused when you said you were going to something called “ADOCH.” What is an ADOCH anyway? What does ADOCH really mean? Not to worry, we’ve figured out the most likely meanings of “ADOCH.”

:::script-list

- A) A Dog On College Hill (college students everywhere rejoice and run to pet it)
- B) A place where ships hang out while they load and empty passengers
- C) The end of a question for your Canadian doctor — eh, Doc?
- D) Another Day Of Chill Hanging-out
- E) A cool way to get your dachshund’s attention — “Ayy, Dach!,” and
- F) The Princeton band. <!-- this one wasn’t in the original but the presence of “, and” above makes me think it’s an oversight -JF -->

Hope that cleared things up a little bit for you! Watch now as the band forms A Delightfully Oblong Curved Hemisphere and plays “A Ding Dong (Song) On College Hill.”

Well, that’s all from us today. A special shoutout to prefrosh Summer Gerry and Jared Finn, who should join the band! But an even more special welcome to the rest of you, who should also join the band. And you should all come to Brown (...sexually)! Brown Band out.
