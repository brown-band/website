Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization 
that likes recursion, it's the Brown University "it's the Brown University
 Band" BANDDDDDDD!!!!!

Weeeeeee're back! After an exciting summer of surfing, swimming, and 
twitter-stalking Tupper the Bulldog, we're glad to be back and surrounded 
by familiar and unfamiliar faces. To those of you on the other side of 
the field: welcome back to Providence, Bryant! While you're here, 
consider stopping by your old buildings, Perkins Hall and Orwig Music 
Library, which we acquired in a '69 deal. Meaning we bought them in 1969,
 of course. They sure built 'em better back in the day. Orwig actually 
 used to be a hospital, which is useful when your buildings collapse. 
 Luckily, we haven't had building performance problems here since last 
 winter. Watch now as the band renovates Bryant's campus and plays Build 
 Me Up Buttercup.

As for the rest of you new faces, welcome, first-years! Now that you've 
made it through orientation, here are a few things you can look forward 
to this fall: Blue Room muffins, donuts handed to you by naked people 
while you study, the full moons when Circle Dance comes to life and makes 
mayhem, and five fresh feet of snow every day once winter starts in early 
October! Ah, college. Watch now as the band forms a B and plays For Bruno 
and For Brown.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's 
getting all riled up, it's the Brown University "let's talk about sex, baby" 
BANDDDDDDD!!!!!!

Brown and Bryant actually have a lot in common - we're both second-place 
award winners! Bryant is the second-best value school in Rhode Island, 
and according to OKCupid, Brown students have the second-highest sex drive
 out of the top 20 colleges as ranked by the U.S. News and World Report. 
 Also, we're the first-best value school in Rhode Island. Probably our 
 higher sex drive makes us better value. Or so our partners tell us. Watch
 now as the band forms what you can use to drive our car and plays Stacy's
 Mom.

According to results of that same OKCupid study, Brown students are ranked first in 
partying and third in attractiveness! Someone should have told us thatâ€¦ we feel like 
we've been missing out. Time to get our senior scramble on... or our junior scramble, 
or our sophomore scramble, or even our freshman scramble! We're really not particular. 
As long as when we get up in the morning our eggs aren't scrambled - or worse, fertilized. 
Watch now as the band forms a glass vase and plays More Than a Feeling.
