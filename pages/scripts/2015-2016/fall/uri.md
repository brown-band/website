## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s still living in the past, it’s the Brown University "It sure beats our mother’s basement!" BAAAAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDDDD!

Hey Brown football fans, you may not know this, but today is the Brown Band alumni game! We’re so excited to to be joined by our alumni, who traveled miles and years to get here. That’s right, our alumni can time travel. They’ve braved the the War of 1812, the Spanish Inquisition, and even Joshua blowing the walls of Jericho down just to be a part of today’s Battle of the Rhode Island Universities! Dang, that’s dedication. Watch now as the the Band reenacts what its alumni helped Joshua do back in biblical times.

On the subject of Rhode Island universities, it seems URI students have a desire to feel more connected to the officers policing their campus. So, URI police have recently started using segways get around campus. We don’t really get how putting someone on wheels makes them more approachable, but whatever. In keeping with URI’s goals, here’s a list of other transportation modes that foster a sense of community policing.

- A. A Trojan horse
- B. Heelys
- C. Broken escalators that are actually just stairs
- D. Paddle Boats
- E. Piggy-back rides, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Watch now as the band forms two hot air balloons and plays "Brown Man Airborne."

Well it looks like it’s time to get to the Battle of Little Rhody. Who will win? Bears or Rams? Coke or Pepsi? Up or down? Gilbert or Sullivan? How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop? Only time will tell.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is world renowned for its smarts, savvy, and satirical take on students who can’t spell good or use grammar proper, it’s the Brown University "now outsourcing our scriptwriting to alumni" BAND!

Belinda the Brown Student has grown disaffected with the supercilious, sycophantic, career-focused, and ambitious drones traipsing around her school’s Ivy colored walls. So, Belinda has driven to Kingston today and has met Roger the Rhode Island student for their first date at the Brown vs. URI Governor’s Cup. Although Roger is oblivious to the fact that the URI’s Ram mascot, colors, and fight song were plagiarized from the University of North Carolina, Belinda is wise to their game. Watch now as Belinda and the band put on their political protester caps and plays "UNC Wants Their Fight Song Back."

After Brown wins the game and hoists the prized Governor’s Cup containing all of the beer smuggled out of URI’s so-called dry campus, Roger the Rhode Islander tries to whet Belinda the Brown Student’s appetite for romance by taking her out to a coffee shop and ordering them both a grinder and a tall, creamy coffee cabinet. As Belinda chokes on the disgusting sludge-filled milkshake and begins to feel light-headed, she decides she is done feigning interest in Roger. Belinda makes a mad dash for the exit, only to find that the door has been barricaded by robots! Fearing that her life has devolved into the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Belinda closes her eyes and envisions the Brown Band arriving to her rescue. Watch now as the Brown Band forms a time machine and performs "Time Warp."

After the machinations and freaky lightshow end, Belinda the Brown Student awakes and finds she has been transported away from Kingston and back to Providence. Belinda vows never to date a URI student again. Her classmates remind her that while Brown’s distinguished graduates include titans of business, academia, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, URI’s graduates include Tenzil Kim, winner of the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for the invention of the cat selfie, and Raymond Patriarca, Jr., a member of the notorious Providence crime family. Fearing for her life, Belinda enlists the Brown Band to protect her from the robot mafia. Belinda cheers with the Band as they form a "B" and performs "Brown Cheering Song."

Since next week our team is away at Holy Cross, we’ll see you back at Historic Brown Stadium on October 17 when we take on the Fightin’ Tigers! Thanks to alums Schuyler von Oeyen ’05, Wilson Baer ’13, Danny Gleave ’13, Lena Barsky ’14, and Zoe Fieldsteel ’15 for their scriptwriting help today! Smell ya later, alligators, Brown Band out.
