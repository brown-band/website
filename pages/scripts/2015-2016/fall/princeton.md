## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's excited for Mom to do all our laundry, it's the Brown University "home is where the free food is" BANDDDDDDDDDDDD!

We're so excited to have Princeton here after our tempestuous love affair on their home field last year. You may remember the dramatic tale of Brunoneo and Princetoniette, ending on a happy note with the birth of our child, Johnny. However, within mere hours of the end of that game, Brunoneo and Princetoniette had an amicable split as Brunoneo had to return to Brown with the band. Also, it wouldn't have lasted long anyway, if the honeymoon was any indication. But we're so happy that we could have Johnny's family back together for family weekend. Watch now as the band forms a Princeton legacy's family tree and plays "Band Romance."

But honestly, we all know that the real reason we want our parents to visit us is to grant us temporary reprieve from such Ratty delicacies as "French Taco Sandwich" and "Garden-Style Scrod." Besides taking us out to dinner, here are some more parenting tasks we wish our parents would do this weekend.

:::script-list

- A. Vacuuming our dorm room
- B. Microwaving the ramen we're having for dinner at 11pm
- C. Nagging our roommates to clean so we don't have to
- D. Writing our English paper for us
- E. Really, we mostly want the free food, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Time to go hang out with our parents - I mean, watch the football game! See you at halftime.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's glad our opponents are already in the October Halloween spirit, it's the Brown University "Princeton's color scheme actually makes sense for once" BANDDDDDDDDDDDD!

We've just learned that next year's freshmen at Princeton will have a new model for orientation where all freshmen arrive at the same time for a more "unified experience in transitioning from high school graduates to Princeton students." The new orientation will include a program called "reflections on diversity," which we assume is to help freshmen transition from their diverse high schools to the all-white, all-wealthy homogeneity of Princeton. We have an idea that will help save money on programming: to reflect on Princeton's diversity, just have students look at their reflections in a mirror. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all. Watch now as the band forms the official Princeton loaf of wonderbread and plays "Pretty Fly for a Rich White Guy."

We also just learned about a fun Princeton tradition called "Newman's Day," where students try to drink 24 beers in 24 hours. On this day, students frequently show up to class drunk, clutching coffee mugs full of beer. Participants are forbidden to sleep or vomit during the 24 hour time period, or else they have to start counting again from zero. As far as we're concerned, they're already at zero. Not even starting over again can help these tipsy tigers become cool cats. Watch now as the band prepares for class and plays "Jungle Boozy."

After drinking 24 beers in 24 hours, we expect that Princeton students might wish they were dead. Once they actually die, though (whether by alcohol poisoning or another way), we've found a stylish new after-death option for them: eternal rest on the moon. For only $10,000 dollars, you too can be buried among the stars. The main impediment is transportation, but we figure with a little creativity and a Princeton student's estate, we can rig up some kind of corpse rocket that will do the trick. Watch now as the band forms two moons that your remains will someday inhabit and plays "For Moon-o And For Brown."

That's all for this week! Catch us next week preparing for the icy afterlife at Cornell. See you on the other side.
