Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that 
is definitely at this football game, it's the Brown University "we've 
never had a controversial thought in our lives" BANDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
The band is so happy to be in this winter wonderland, home of the crown 
jewel of higher education in upstate New York: Ithaca College! Ithaca 
College was the home of such illustrious alumni as The Twilight Zone 
creator Rod Serling, Emmy-nominated actor Ben Feldman, and same-sex 
marriage opponent and War on Drugs supporter Ann Coulter—oh, wait, that 
last one was a misprint. Ithaca College graduates are true stand-up 
individuals, indeed paragons of the virtues of American Higher Education. 
Watch now as the band forms a frowny face and plays "Sad-Eyed Girl".

Speaking of American heroes, we're thrilled to be witnessing a true 
triumph of the human spirit today: a group of athletes trying to win 
their first game of the season against all odds. Surprisingly, for once 
we aren't talking about the Brown football team. For the first time in 
forever, the Bears have a winning record! While we're happy about this 
year's performance, we're still basking in the glow of our Rose Bowl 
appearance in 1916. Oh, what a time it was to be alive. It's a shame 
that most people alive in 1916 are dead now. 
</sp>
<sp>
Watch now as the Band rates your performance and plays "Brown Bear."

That's all for now. Catch us at halftime for more of our unabridged shenanigans!

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization 
that loves the Bill of Rights, it's the Brown University "first 10 
amendments and do it again, go Bears go!" BANDDDDDDDDDDD!

We saw in the news recently that Cornell's president, Elizabeth Garrett, 
is an avid supporter of freedom of speech! According to her, the whole 
university should be a "free speech zone," and higher education is about 
"the fullest and freest expression of ideas." This makes a lot of sense 
to us, as it's completely consistent with the Cornell we know and love. 
After all, what supports the value of free speech more strongly than 
Cornell University, with its admirable goal of instruction in any study 
for any person? 
</sp>
<sp>
Watch now as the band forms a free speech zone and plays "Midnight Special".

While we were thinking about freedom of speech, we got curious about 
censorship. After all, we've all heard of Banned Books Week and Net 
Neutrality. Imagine a world without books like Beloved and Persepolis, 
or websites like YouTube. Free access to information is part of free 
society, even when things get controversial—just ask Edward Snowden! 
We're so glad that Cornell is advocating against such sanitization of 
ideas.

Watch now as the band freely expresses speech and plays "Never 
Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley.

Just to be sure about what we're talking about when we talk about 
censorship, we checked Wikipedia for its definition. Here it is, 
in easily digestible list form:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication or other information</sli>
<sli>B. which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect</sli>
<sli>C. or inconvenient</sli>
<sli>D. as determined by governments, media outlets, authorities or</sli>
<sli>E. other groups or institutions. And,</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Yeah, that sounds like the definition of censorship to us! Watch now as 
the band experiences Two Minutes Hate and plays [CENSORED] Forevermore.

It's been a fun time talking about the First Amendment with you all 
today here in beautiful Mythica! Catch us next week at home as we take 
on Penn in a spooky Halloween showdown. Brown Band out.
