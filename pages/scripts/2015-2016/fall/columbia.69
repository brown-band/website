Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that 
isn't sure where it is right now, it's the Brown University "Brown 
University Band in the City of New York" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
Here we are: New York. The Big City. The Big Apple. The City That Never 
Sleeps. The City So Nice They Named It Twice. The best city since Old 
York. The home of the Pizza Rat. The Helm's Deep of the East Coast. The 
Ba Sing Se of the Batman Universe. The Gotham of the Fire Nation. The 
Land Down Under. Hell's Port-A-Potty. 
</sp>
<sp>
Watch now as the band puts 50 people on some grass and blows some hot air.
</sp>
<sp><sd>Band forms turbulent flow and plays "B flat Cheering Song".</sd></sp>

We've heard a lot of buzz recently about a Columbia senior's endeavor to start a
 restaurant in his dorm room. We admire his efforts, considering how little success 
 we've had with making our own concoctions at home. Here's a list of some of our
 most successful dorm room creations.
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. The warm, green, and fuzzy blanket growing on my wall</sli>
<sli>B. Tetrahydrocannabinol</sli>
<sli>C. A two-course meal featuring ramen and uncrustables</sli>
<sli>D. Bandcest</sli>
<sli>E. Fruit-fly utopias, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>

While perusing the New York Post, we came across an article detailing 
one professor's immersive research techniques, used to study how social 
interactions at bars impact sexual experiences. However, in order to 
fit in, Professor Khan admitted that he sometimes faked drinking alcohol 
and getting drunk. We, too, have faked a lot of things before, such as:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Being the tooth fairy</sli>
<sli>B. SANTA CLAUS ISN'T REAL</sli>
<sli>C. Our love for Cornell, its fans, its alumni, its football team, and the beautiful city of Ithaca</sli>
<sli>D. Orgasms</sli>
<sli>E. Our sunny disposition on this cold, dark night, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Watch now as the Band forms a solution to list entry D and "Fakes on Me".
</sp>
<sp><sd>Band forms a rabbit and plays "Take on Me".</sd></sp>
<sp>
Well, this is our last game of the season. You may have noticed we've 
run out of ideas. That's just how it goes sometimes. Here's a list of 
some of our favorite lists.
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Santa Claus's naughty or nice list</sli>
<sli>B. 95 Theses: Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences</sli>
<sli>C. Groceries to shop for</sli>
<sli>D. People who've wronged us, and all the ways in which we plan to exact revenge</sli>
<sli>E. This script, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Turn your attention to the field as the Band forms two curved shopping 
lists and plays "List-Ing the Victory".
</sp>
<sp><sd>Band forms a B and plays "Bring the Victory".</sd></sp>
