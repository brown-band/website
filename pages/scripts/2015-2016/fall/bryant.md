## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that likes recursion, it's the Brown University "it's the Brown University Band" BANDDDDDDD!!!!!

Weeeeeee're back! After an exciting summer of surfing, swimming, and twitter-stalking Tupper the Bulldog, we're glad to be back and surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar faces. To those of you on the other side of the field: welcome back to Providence, Bryant! While you're here, consider stopping by your old buildings, Perkins Hall and Orwig Music Library, which we acquired in a '69 deal. Meaning we bought them in 1969, of course. They sure built 'em better back in the day. Orwig actually used to be a hospital, which is useful when your buildings collapse. Luckily, we haven't had building performance problems here since last winter. Watch now as the band renovates Bryant's campus and plays Build Me Up Buttercup.

As for the rest of you new faces, welcome, first-years! Now that you've made it through orientation, here are a few things you can look forward to this fall: Blue Room muffins, donuts handed to you by naked people while you study, the full moons when Circle Dance comes to life and makes mayhem, and five fresh feet of snow every day once winter starts in early October! Ah, college. Watch now as the band forms a B and plays For Bruno and For Brown.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's getting all riled up, it's the Brown University "let's talk about sex, baby" BANDDDDDDD!!!!!!

Brown and Bryant actually have a lot in common - we're both second-place award winners! Bryant is the second-best value school in Rhode Island, and according to OKCupid, Brown students have the second-highest sex drive out of the top 20 colleges as ranked by the U.S. News and World Report. Also, we're the first-best value school in Rhode Island. Probably our higher sex drive makes us better value. Or so our partners tell us. Watch now as the band forms what you can use to drive our car and plays Stacy's Mom.

According to results of that same OKCupid study, Brown students are ranked first in partying and third in attractiveness! Someone should have told us thatâ€¦ we feel like we've been missing out. Time to get our senior scramble on... or our junior scramble, or our sophomore scramble, or even our freshman scramble! We're really not particular. As long as when we get up in the morning our eggs aren't scrambled - or worse, fertilized. Watch now as the band forms a glass vase and plays More Than a Feeling.
