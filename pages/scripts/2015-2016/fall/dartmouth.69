Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that can't see the forest for
 the tree stumps, it's the Brown University "we're soOoOo poplar-lar" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
We discovered recently that Dartmouth has a "Woodsmen's Team." What is this noble sport, you
 ask? We don't really know, but their website describes "the thrilling ring and crunch of the keen
 axes as they bite into the peeled and glistening wood... You stand on top of an 8-inch-thick
 block of poplar thinking you will never break through. Then your axe severs the last fibers
 and you collapse, surrounded by a whooping and hooting circle of friends."  Now that you mention
 it, this doesn't sound half bad.
</sp>
<sp>
Watch now as the band forms a lumberjack's trusty axe and plays "I Chop Some Wood."

Speaking of wood, we heard that a dead tree stump on campus, the "Lone Pine," is having a surge in
poplarity as a Dartmouth mascot. We feel bad that the best mascot options you have are a 100-year-old
tree stump, an anthropomorphized keg, and Pantone color 349, so we racked our brains and came up with
a few suggestions for what your new official mascot should be.

<sli>A. A lone yob starting fires in the wilderness</sli>
<sli>B. Treebeard and his happy tree friends</sli>
<sli>C. Your ~favorite~ sheep</sli>
<sli>D. Hard alcohol, since that's the only way to get it on campus</sli>
<sli>E. A living tree. Literally any living tree, and </sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Watch now as the band forms two tree stumps and plays "Brown Bear." <sd>The Voice of One Brown Bear Crying
Out in the Wilderness</sd>

Stay tuned for some celebrations and some tears at halftime as we honor our graduating seniors!

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants to give rhyming a try,
it's the Brown University "this will surely make us cry, <sd>pause</sd> omg did you see what we did
there?" BAANNNNNNDD!!!!!!!!!!
</sp>
<sp>
If you didn't know, today is our senior game! We have so many feelings about our graduating seniors
(please FOUR MORE YEARS) and we want to tell them to you in the only way we know how. While we thank
you, remember to show your love for us next year... with your wallets, of course, when you make
generous donations to the Brown University Band. Watch now as the band honors its seniors by
forming their favorite drink, which they can now legally consume, and drops some sick rhymes.

Amy's exit will leave us distressed,<sbr/>
Her scripts were truly the best<sbr/>
She has Delaware Pride,<sbr/>
and would take it in stride<sbr/>
When we asked "Are we there yet?" in jest.
</sp>
<sp>
Of Our Money Godfather Cooper-Troendle,<sbr/>
Cheering with him sure was pretty fun-dle,<sbr/>
When he spread and wailed<sbr/>
Our love never failed<sbr/>
We surely will miss him a bundle!
</sp>
<sp>
Fair Brooke is our CorSec from Penn,<sbr/>
Upon her we always depend<sbr/>
On the sax she does honk<sbr/>
Followed by a good "WONK"<sbr/>
Our hearts swell with love for our friend.
</sp>
<sp>
Our wonderful Prez Sidney Karesh<sbr/>
Whose smiles we will always cherish,<sbr/>
Your costumes are sleek<sbr/>
with particular chic<sbr/>
Our love for you will never perish.
</sp>
<sp>
Here's to Jesus, our cool pal <sbr/>
We love his sick moves during Al.<sbr/>
A master of kazoo,<sbr/>
and piccolo, too,<sbr/>
And miss him dearly, we shall.
</sp>
<sp>
Oh, how we'll miss Kenneth Lin<sbr/>
The saxophone section he's in.<sbr/>
A music maestro he is,<sbr/>
On the piano, what a whiz<sbr/>
When we're with him, the band always wins.
</sp>
<sp>
Carlos Lopez is an awesome DJ,<sbr/>
The guitar, trumpet, and snare he did play<sbr/>
We'll miss him a lot,<sbr/>
We'd rather have him than not,<sbr/>
Oh please please please don't go away.
</sp>
<sp>
As one of the Three Musketeers,<sbr/>
Armani's smile filled us with cheers,<sbr/>
To NYC he did lead us,<sbr/>
On t-bone he did please us,<sbr/>
When he leaves we will be filled with tears.
</sp>
<sp>
We know we will miss Mermelhammer,<sbr/>
Whose banging on drums made a clamor<sbr/>
it always was grand<sbr/>
when he played with one hand<sbr/>
while juggling his mallets with glamour.
</sp>
<sp>
Goodbye to our gangly friend Charlie<sbr/>
whose conducting skills were quite gnarly<sbr/>
he'd get up on the stands<sbr/>
and wave those perfect hands<sbr/>
We'd even watch sometimes, bizarrely.
</sp>
<sp>
Here's to our scriptwriter Abby,<sbr/>
Whose prose was nothing too shabby,<sbr/>
That skill with a sax<sbr/>
And spirit to the max<sbr/>
Her absence will sure make us crabby!
</sp>
<sp>
Anaisa is queen with her crown<sbr/>
Her spirit radiates throughout Brown<sbr/>
She rocks on that mello<sbr/>
Our hearts turn to jello<sbr/>
When she leaves we'll collectively frown.
</sp>
<sp>
Our dear old friend Chris the VP,<sbr/>
Could sure harmonize to a T,<sbr/>
As money god was fantastic <sbr/>
Playing trombone of plastic<sbr/>
Without you how sad we will be!
</sp>
<sp>
We will miss our dear Grandma named Ben<sbr/>
Who is always 11 out of 10<sbr/>
His hats will amuse<sbr/>
on any instrument he's muse<sbr/>
His caliber won't be matched again.
</sp>

We guess this is goodbye, beloved seniors! Thank you for four incredible years, but thankfully we've
still got the football game at Columbia Columbia next Friday and all of hockey season to show our love
for you. Brown Band out!
