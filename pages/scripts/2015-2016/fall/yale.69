Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization 
whose jokes write themselves, it's the Brown University "let's just 
talk about their football team" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

All right, let's get this out of the way early. Last weekend, a miracle 
happened on Central Avenue—you "let" the Columbia football team win its 
first Ivy League game since 2012. Since they last won, Columbia has been 
outscored by about 700 points. Last time Columbia won a game, we were 
still waiting for the Mayan apocalypse. The world may not have ended 
then, but Columbia winning a game against Yale now indicates the end is 
near. By the transitive property, losing to the worst team in the Ivy 
League makes YOU the worst football team in the Ivy League.

We think we figured out why Yale has been struggling at football. 
According to OkCupid, Yale students have the highest sex drive out of 
the top 20 colleges as ranked by the U.S. News and World Report. We 
suspect that the football team has not been trying their hardest when 
practicing handling balls. For the record, Brown was ranked second, 
but our football team is much better at balancing rough play and 
football.

Watch now as the band rates Yale's performance last night and 
plays "For Porno and For Brown."

That's all for now! Join us at halftime for another sexhilarating performance.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization 
that has just one college, it's the Brown University "a house divided 
cannot stand" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Recently, the Economist released a list of schools ranked on how much 
money their alumni make after graduation, compared to how much they're 
expected to make. On this list, Yale was ranked 1270th. Out of 1275 
schools. That's almost (but not quite) as embarrassing as losing a 
football game to Columbia. Honestly, Brown didn't do much better, so 
at least we can all be united against our common enemy, ranked at 4th 
place: Harvard. Those bastards. Watch now as the band forms a Harvard 
grad's soul and plays "A Harvard Day's Night."

Recently, we've all been held rapt by our #1 news source for all things 
fleeting: The Ivy Campus Snapchat Story. Before, if we wanted to watch 
short bursts of people studying for midterms, doing strange dances, or 
playing football, we had to go find them ourselves and blink rapidly! 
Now we have access to all of it in one place—what a game-changer. Here 
is a list of ideas we've had to get Snapchat-famous.
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Making fun of Yale's team, fans, university, alumni, or the beautiful city of New Haven</sli>
<sli>B. Shouting out to the other Ivy bands, omg!</sli>
<sli>C. Selling our souls to <sd>the devil</sd> Yale</sli>
<sli>D. Mentioning the Ivy Campus Snapchat Story in a script - we hope someone is recording this</sli>
<sli>E. The Cinnamon Challenge, but with cocaine, and </sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>

Watch now as the band forms our snap story and plays "Our Smooth Dance 
Moves Will Get Us On The Snap Story Please God We're Desperate."
</sp>

We sure are glad we don't have to come back to Yale for another two 
years, but there is one thing we're happy is returning to New Haven 
sooner: Gilmore Girls! Yale doesn't have a lot going for it, but it does 
have our favorite alumna, Rory Gilmore. We couldn't be more excited that 
this iconic show is returning to Netflix soon, because it's the only 
thing that's ever made Yale seem like a semi-bearable place to go to 
school. Although honestly, Rory went home, like, every weekend, so even 
she didn't seem to enjoy it all that much. Watch now as the band forms 
"Buffering" and plays "In The Netflix Queue."
</sp>
<sp><sd>Band forms a B and plays "In the Fray."</sd></sp>
<sp>
Join us next week as the band heads back to Brown for more sex, drugs, 
and rock and roll. We have a feeling Dartmouth will be able to help us 
with most of that. Brown Band out.
