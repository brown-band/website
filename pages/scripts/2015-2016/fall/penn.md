## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s going trick-or-treating right after this, it’s the Brown University "you’re never too old for free candy" BAAANNNNNNDDDDDD!!!!!!!

It’s our favorite month again, Spook-tober! We’re so excited, we changed into spook-takular Halloween costumes to mark the occasion. Even the football team is joining in the costume spook-travaganza, with their face paint and their tight pants. Literally nothing could be scarier than that! Except the idea of going to Penn. That’s pretty scary. Our only regret is that soon the spook-fest will end.

Watch now as the band remains in the spooky spirit and plays "Ghostbusters."

Speaking of Halloween, we’re always excited to see what culturally relevant costumes people will come up with—especially the sexy versions. Here’s a list of our favorite topical sexy Halloween costumes.

:::script-list

- A. Sexy Minion
- B. Sexy Donald Trump
- C. Sexy Potato
- D. Sexy Donald Trump’s toupee
- E. Sexy Pizza Rat, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

We can’t wait to see every person we know wearing these costumes tonight. But in the meantime, watch now as the band wears our non-sexy costumes, forms two jack-o’-lanterns, and plays "Brown Candy Corn."

That’s all for now. Catch us at halftime for more spookiness!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that knows this game is gonna be HUUUGGGEEE, it’s the Brown University "our trumps trump your Trump" BAAANNNNNNDDDDDD!!!!!!!

Last week, we stacked our script with jokes about Cornell’s most esteemed alum, Ann Coulter, and made the trek up to Ithaca only to be silenced by their oppressive reign of censors and poor senses of humor. (For the record, Ann Coulter went to Cornell.) Joke’s on you guys, though, because it turns out her favorite person is one of your alums. We’re sure you know where we’re going with this. And you’re right.

DONALD TRUMP WENT TO PENN.

We’re so sorry. But it’s okay—at least his hair can’t run for President. Watch now as the band forms the monster that lives on Trump’s head and plays "No Soul Man."

Recently, Trump was quoted as saying, "We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don’t have it." We can only assume he’s talking about his college football team. After all, sports and politics have a lot in common: whoever has the most sponsors tends to come out on top. We can only hope that Trump, who is coincidentally his own sponsor, will go bankrupt again before he evolves into his final form: a hairball coughed up by an eagle.

Watch now as the band forms Trump Tower and plays "The (Hairline) Recession That I Get."

Speaking of things that bring only despair, we noticed that Penn’s campus blog has a series called "Most Depressing Places On Campus." We would like to suggest an addition to the list: the abandoned pile of toast on Penn’s track. In the last 36 years, you’ve thrown (at minimum) 54,000 pounds of bread onto the track. Imagine about how many sandwiches that is. Then double that and imagine how many open-face sandwiches that is.

Watch now as the band runs out of bread and goes to Wawa instead.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays "Bring the Victory."]

Join us next week as the Band prevents Handsome Dan from drinking out of the Yale Bowl. Brown Band out.
