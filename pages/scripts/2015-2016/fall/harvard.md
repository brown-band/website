## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that drove and drove across the Massachusetts, it's the Brown University "just 50 friends hanging out together" BANDDDDDDDD!

We have to admit we're a little intimidated to be here today, considering that Harvard's football team has won its last 15 games. But with a winning streak that long, we feel like they must be compensating for... something. After all, while football prowess wins you fame in the streets, we all know that what really matters is fame in the sheets... of paper. Go for those diplomas, kids! Watch now as the band forms a Harvard Diploma and plays "I Teach Myself."

Speaking of compensation, we noticed that Harvard is pretty interested in the sex lives - or lack thereof - of their incoming freshman. What's really important, though, according to the Harvard Crimson, is how those sex lives compare to the sex lives of Yale's incoming freshmen. We know that when you have a rival school, sometimes you hate them so much that you have to make sure that they're not having sex with anyone else, because, like, it's not like it matters, God, whatever. It's okay, Harvard. We know.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization who just learned that our lives have lost all meaning, it's the Brown University "Froyo is dead, long live froyo" BANDDDDDDDD!

We would like to have a moment of silence in honor of the closing of Yogurtland, the temple and shrine of the students of Harvard University. "I was actually devastated. I was genuinely devastated. Yogurtland for me as a freshman, was a place of solace," said one sophomore. A senior added, "Yogurtland was the holy place for me." We suggest that these students take a class in Religious Studies and learn what the word "holy" means, and then get a reality check. Watch now as the band demonstrates our religious education and plays "Livin' on a Prayer."

You may have heard that Harvard recently announced the winners of the Ig Nobel prize. This esteemed award acknowledges such achievements as discovering that all mammals pee for somewhere between 8 and 34 seconds, that chickens with sticks attached to them walk like dinosaurs, and that it hurts when bees sting men on their dingle dongles. Here's a list of our discoveries that we think we deserve awards for:

:::script-list

- A. We finally figured out which school you mean when you say "I went to school in Boston",
- B. We learned how to graduate from college without taking any of our classes for a grade,
- C. We figured out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop,
- D. We discovered the theory of relativity, just in time for our physics exam,
- E. We've discovered the largest possible number of ways to form a soda bottle and two cups on a football field, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Watch now as the band forms an award-winning tootsie roll pop and plays the "Dingle Dongle Song."

We noticed that you seem to have a lot of tourists wandering around your campus. We're not sure what they think they're here to see. As far as we can tell, mostly you sleep, eat, go to class, and have thoroughly underwhelming amounts of sex. These tourists should come to Brown instead. We'd put on a much better show. Watch now as the band forms a pair of binoculars and plays "Bring on the Tourists."

Well, we're off to pay homage to the dearly departed Yogurtland. Catch us next weekend at Brown as we continue our domination of the Governor's Cup! Brown band out.
