We're so excited to have Princeton here after our tempestuous love 
affair on their home field last year. You may remember the dramatic 
tale of Brunoneo and Princetoniette, ending on a happy note with the 
birth of our child, Johnny. However, within mere hours of the end of 
that game, Brunoneo and Princetoniette had an amicable split as Brunoneo 
had to return to Brown with the band. Also, it wouldn't have lasted 
long anyway, if the honeymoon was any indication. But we're so happy 
that we could have Johnny's family back together for family weekend. 
Watch now as the band forms a Princeton legacy's family tree and plays 
"Band Romance."

But honestly, we all know that the real reason we want our parents to 
visit us is to grant us temporary reprieve from such Ratty delicacies 
as "French Taco Sandwich" and "Garden-Style Scrod." Besides taking us 
out to dinner, here are some more parenting tasks we wish our parents 
would do this weekend.

<sul>
<sli>A. Vacuuming our dorm room</sli>
<sli>B. Microwaving the ramen we're having for dinner at 11pm</sli>
<sli>C. Nagging our roommates to clean so we don't have to</sli>
<sli>D. Writing our English paper for us</sli>
<sli>E. Really, we mostly want the free food, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

Time to go hang out with our parents - I mean, watch the football game! 
See you at halftime.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization 
that's glad our opponents are already in the October Halloween spirit, 
it's the Brown University "Princeton's color scheme actually makes 
sense for once" BANDDDDDDDDDDDD!

We've just learned that next year's freshmen at Princeton will have a 
new model for orientation where all freshmen arrive at the same time 
for a more "unified experience in transitioning from high school 
graduates to Princeton students." The new orientation will include a 
program called "reflections on diversity," which we assume is to help 
freshmen transition from their diverse high schools to the all-white, 
all-wealthy homogeneity of Princeton. We have an idea that will help 
save money on programming: to reflect on Princeton's diversity, just 
have students look at their reflections in a mirror. Once you've seen 
one, you've seen them all. Watch now as the band forms the official 
Princeton loaf of wonderbread and plays "Pretty Fly for a Rich White Guy."

We also just learned about a fun Princeton tradition called "Newman's 
Day," where students try to drink 24 beers in 24 hours. On this day, 
students frequently show up to class drunk, clutching coffee mugs full 
of beer. Participants are forbidden to sleep or vomit during the 24 
hour time period, or else they have to start counting again from zero. 
As far as we're concerned, they're already at zero. Not even starting 
over again can help these tipsy tigers become cool cats. Watch now as 
the band prepares for class and plays "Jungle Boozy."

After drinking 24 beers in 24 hours, we expect that Princeton students might 
wish they were dead. Once they actually die, though (whether by alcohol
 poisoning or another way), we've found a stylish new after-death option 
 for them: eternal rest on the moon. For only $10,000 dollars, you too 
 can be buried among the stars. The main impediment is transportation, 
 but we figure with a little creativity and a Princeton student's estate, 
 we can rig up some kind of corpse rocket that will do the trick. Watch 
 now as the band forms two moons that your remains will someday inhabit 
 and plays "For Moon-o And For Brown."

That's all for this week! Catch us next week preparing for the icy 
afterlife at Cornell. See you on the other side.
