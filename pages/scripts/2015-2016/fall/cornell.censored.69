Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that 
is definitely at this football game, it's the Brown University "we've 
never had a controversial thought in our lives" BANDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
The band is so happy to be in this winter wonderland, home of the crown 
jewel of higher education in upstate New York: Ithaca College! Ithaca 
College was the home of such illustrious alumni as The Twilight Zone 
creator Rod Serling, Emmy-nominated actor Ben Feldman, and same-sex 
marriage opponent and War on Drugs supporter Ann Coulter—oh, wait, 
that last one was a misprint. Ithaca College graduates are true stand-up 
individuals, indeed paragons of the virtues of American Higher Education. 
Watch now as the band forms a frowny face and plays "Sad-Eyed Girl."

Speaking of American heroes, we're thrilled to be witnessing a true 
triumph of the human spirit today: a group of athletes trying to win 
a game. In fact, as with most sports events, we have two groups of 
athletes each trying to win a game! Surprisingly, for once we like 
Brown's odds. For the first time in forever, the Brown Bears have a
 winning record! While we're happy about this year's performance, 
 we're still basking in the glow of our Rose Bowl appearance in 1916. 
 Oh, what a time it was to be alive. It's a shame that most people 
 alive in 1916 are dead now.

<sp>
Watch now as the Band rates your performance and plays "Brown Bear."

That's all for now. Catch us at halftime for more of our unabridged shenanigans!

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization 
that's ready to bear our souls, it's the Brown University "we're all 
bears here" BANDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
A-bear-ica: land of the free, home of the bear-ave. With your color 
and mascot like the rocket's red bear in our national anthem, you're 
so patriotic we can bear-ly believe it. Speaking of bears, there are 
a lot of them at this game today. In fact, there could be a bear RIGHT 
BEHIND YOU! Or maybe even one standing on the opposing sideline...
</sp>
<sp>
Bear witness as the band bewares the werebears that come out at night 
and plays "Midnight Werebears."
</sp>

Watch now as the band speaks our minds and plays "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley.

You may have noticed how funny and appropriate our script is today! 
That's because it contains a few of our favorite elements that always 
make for a winning script.

Catch us next week as we take on Penn in a spooky and, since we're 
playing a home game,  hilarious Halloween showdown. Brown Band out.
