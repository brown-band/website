It's our favorite month again, Spook-tober! We're so excited, we changed 
into spook-takular Halloween costumes to mark the occasion. Even the 
football team is joining in the costume spook-travaganza, with their 
face paint and their tight pants. Literally nothing could be scarier 
than that! Except the idea of going to Penn. That's pretty scary. 
Our only regret is that soon the spook-fest will end. 
</sp>
<sp>
Watch now as the band remains in the spooky spirit and plays "Ghostbusters."

Speaking of Halloween, we're always excited to see what culturally 
relevant costumes people will come up with—especially the sexy versions. 
Here's a list of our favorite topical sexy Halloween costumes. 
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Sexy Minion</sli>
<sli>B. Sexy Donald Trump</sli>
<sli>C. Sexy Potato</sli>
<sli>D. Sexy Donald Trump's toupee</sli>
<sli>E. Sexy Pizza Rat, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
We can't wait to see every person we know wearing these costumes tonight. 
But in the meantime, watch now as the band wears our non-sexy 
costumes, forms two jack-o'-lanterns, and plays "Brown Candy Corn."

That's all for now. Catch us at halftime for more spookiness!

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization 
that knows this game is gonna be HUUUGGGEEE, it's the Brown University 
"our trumps trump your Trump" BAAANNNNNNDDDDDD!!!!!!!

Last week, we stacked our script with jokes about Cornell's most esteemed 
alum, Ann Coulter, and made the trek up to Ithaca only to be silenced by 
their oppressive reign of censors and poor senses of humor. (For the 
record, Ann Coulter went to Cornell.) Joke's on you guys, though, because 
it turns out her favorite person is one of your alums. We're sure you 
know where we're going with this. And you're right.

DONALD TRUMP WENT TO PENN.
</sp>
<sp>
We're so sorry. But it's okay—at least his hair can't run for President. 
Watch now as the band forms the monster that lives on Trump's head and 
plays "No Soul Man."

Recently, Trump was quoted as saying, "We have losers. We have losers. 
We have people that don't have it." We can only assume he's talking about 
his college football team. After all, sports and politics have a lot in 
common: whoever has the most sponsors tends to come out on top. We can 
only hope that Trump, who is coincidentally his own sponsor, will go 
bankrupt again before he evolves into his final form: a hairball coughed 
up by an eagle. 
</sp>
<sp>
Watch now as the band forms Trump Tower and plays "The (Hairline) Recession That I Get."

Speaking of things that bring only despair, we noticed that Penn's campus 
blog has a series called "Most Depressing Places On Campus." We would 
like to suggest an addition to the list: the abandoned pile of toast on 
Penn's track. In the last 36 years, you've thrown (at minimum) 54,000 
pounds of bread onto the track. Imagine about how many sandwiches that 
is. Then double that and imagine how many open-face sandwiches that is.
</sp>
<sp>
Watch now as the band runs out of bread and goes to Wawa instead.
</sp>

Join us next week as the Band prevents Handsome Dan from drinking out of 
the Yale Bowl. Brown Band out.
