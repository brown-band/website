Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that isn't a bird and isn't a plane, it's the Brown University "HOLY COUNTERSKATE, BATMAN!" BAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDD!

Once upon a time, more specifically in 1924, there was a young Brown student named Irving Harris. He was a fine young man who loved music and his university, but had no way to express that love. One fine fall day Mr. Harris was walking along, minding his own business, when suddenly, out of the blue, a radioactive sousaphone jumped out of University Hall and bit him! He fell to the ground, screaming in agony, and promptly blacked out. When he woke up several hours later, he was surrounded by a group of rowdy musicians looking for a leader to unite them. Clutching a mace in his right hand and a bag full of offensive buttons in the other, he screamed, BROWN BAND, ASSEMBLE!! And thus the League of Extraordinary Gentlemusicians, also known as the Brown Band, was born.

Under the watchful eye of Professor McG, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemusicians kept the University spirited at athletic events by day and saved the world from total destruction and ruin by night. Flutes, clarinets, and saxophones incapacitated the bad guys with their woodwind sexiness; trumps mellophone and low brass used their superloud volume to ruin the villains; and percussion literally hit the evildoers in the face because, let's be honest, they're really good at hitting things. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemusicians also had the following powers:

- a) lactose tolerance;
- b) the ability to count to four;
- c) blindingly good looks;
- d) a sixth sense for predicting key changes;
- e) autokinesis, the ability to move ourselves; and
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND!

Professor McG and his League had much success, and were well-loved by all.

Oh no, what's that we hear? It's the Injustice Society of Clarkson! This evil organization from the middle of nowhere, also known as Potsdam, wanted to demolish the League of Extraordinary Gentlemusicians because of how great they sounded. The Injustice Society also watned to turn the entire world into a Frozen Wasteland, convert all Dunkin' Donuts into "The Bagelry," and, perhaps most horrifying of all, they wanted to change every font in the entire world into Comic Sans. Luckily, the Brown Band was able to save the day, and saved the world just in time to perform this ice show for all of you viewers. Clarkson, your music is bad, and you should feel bad.

Phew, first ice show of the year completed! One down, one to go! Come back on February 17 as our Men's Hockey team takes on Harvard's Crimson Flow and, more importantly, the Brown Band and its Alumni put on another ice show! We sure do love our alumni, and we're pretty sure you will, too. Flame on!
