Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that did not have sexual relations with that woman, it's the Brown University, "Do blowjobs count?" BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm sure that you are all aware that this past weekend was Spring Weekend. What you may not be aware of was all of the scandalous shenanigans that happened behind the scenes. It all began the first week of April when BSA Marketplace had a terrible case of the bad gateways, henceforth to be known as badgatewaygate. This was just a last minute excuse that resulted from Scooter Libby sending the Stuxnet virus to the BSA server. The next day all the issues seemed to have been resolved, but our good friend badgatewaygate made a triumphant return this past Friday evening. The BCA told us that they weren't letting us in because Childish Gambino's plane was delayed, but it was actually because the SMU boosters were buying mustangs to get the best GHM staff. This was not badgatewaygate's swan song, as the trapdoor beneath Sepalcure's beat never opened, and the beat never dropped. Thankfully, badgatewaygate disappeared after that mishap and the rest of the weekend went off without a hitch.

There was mass frustration when ResLife released their list of available rooms for the coming year, and there is only one possible reason for the severe lack of rooms: Enron and Madoff were playing checkers, so everyone lost. For those of you who were screwed over by these unfortunate circumstances, here's a list of alternate locations where you can seek residence for the 2012-2013 academic year:

- A. Houseboats in the structure formerly known as the temporary aquatics bubble;
- B. The new Lincoln Field trailer park;
- C. The observatory on the top of Barus and Holley;
- D. The space between Wilson Hall and the John Carter Brown Library now officially known as the What Cheer? Brigade Memorial Patch of Grass;
- E. Perkins; and
- F. The Princeton Band!

While these scandals may seem to be the greatest atrocities to hit our nation since the Surreptitious Sugar Snatch-Up of aught four, the Commander in Chief has been swept up in a couple salacious occurrences of his own. Our great leader has done nothing wrong, but some of those working for him have brought shame upon the tail end of his first term. A government contractor for the GSA has been using their money to plan extravagant conferences with such excess amenities as mind readers and in-room parties; we just want to know why she didn't hire us. In addition several members of Obama's secret service spent their time in Colombia hiring prostitutes and bad-mouthing Obama. They should have just kept it within our borders and come to Providence, because as everyone knows, what happens at Cheaters, stays at Cheaters.

Thanks for coming out to the main green today for the band's last show of the year. We hoped you enjoyed it and encourage you to come hear the band play at the women and men's lacrosse games this Saturday at noon and 3pm respectively, both at Stevenson Field. Good luck with finals and do your best to avoid scandals. See you next fall! Brown Band out.
