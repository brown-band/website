Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that’s won two Grammies, 3 Tonies, and the 1978 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, it’s the Brown University, and I’d just like to take a moment to thank the Academy, BAAAAANNNNDDDDD!!!!

Hello to all the accepted students from the class of 2016. Through our detailed research we discovered that you represent all 50 states as well as 80 nations. 53.2 percent of you are women, 16.2 percent of you are first generation college students, 3.6 percent of you accidentally applied to Brown while trying to apply for a fishing license in Brown Township North Dakota, and at least 0.362 percent of you are named Benjamin or from Alabama, ROLL TIDE.

As you all may or may not be aware, five of Brown’s professors have been named on the Princeton Review’s first ever “300 Best Professor List.” In case you haven’t been spending all of your waking hours on Brown’s website, here’s the run down on who they are.

:::script-list

- a) Barrett Hazeltine, professor of Engineering but wizard of Business. Rides his bike to work, gets paid one dollar a year, and professionally tap dances in his free time.
- b) JOSEPH MICHAEL PUCCI, professor of Classics, Comparative Literature, and Medieval Studies. Can bench press 300 lbs., once threw a knife into heaven, and quote “his wife is really nice.”
- c) Stephanie Ravillon, professor of Foreign Language, French to be specific. Shows up on time... sometimes, makes awesome crepes, and has eaten frog on many occasions.
- d) Robert Serrano, professor of Economics. Denominates all business transactions in the Kazakhstani tenge, recommended that Chipotle be nationalized in order to better distribute burritos to the 99%; and believes in replacing fiat currency with the aluminum standard.
- e) Daniel Stupar, professor of Studio Art. His favorite student organization is the Brown Band, he takes personal credit for what Seth McFarlane has become, and he repainted every single portrait in Sayles Hall after the failed 2003 SPG/Spagfest doubleheader. And finally
- f) THE PRINCETON BAND

Watch now as the Brown Band celebrates these great professors and says SUCK IT HARVARD!! Because they only had two on the list.

It’s been a real treat performing for y’all and providing free advertisement for Brown. We can tell that you’re all bright kids, and we know you’ll make the right decision regarding your future education... unless you end up at Yale, in which case you’re probably beyond saving. We’ll see you on the flip side! Brown Band out!
