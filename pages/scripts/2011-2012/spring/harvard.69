Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's
never gonna give you up, it's the Brown University "Rick Astley Was Cool Once!"
BAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
Welcome, one and all, to the greatest show on heaven, hell, or earth. Why is it so great? Because
we don't just have the Beautiful, Bodacious, Blindingly Brilliant Brown Band skating on the ice
today, we also have our Awesome Alumni! Who doesn't love it when our alumni skate around?
We'd just like to point out to our audience that, unlike the Harvard Band, exactly zero percent of
our alumni have turned out to become the Unabomber. No pressure, guys!

Over Winter Break, while we were all hibernating or getting shot in the knee with some arrows,
Congress decided that instead of trying to help the poor or feed the homeless, they would try to
pass some bills that didn't make any sense and were a complete waste of government resources!
SOPA, PIPA, and their overseas friend, ACTA, drove the internet crazy and were the biggest
uproar in the world of piracy since Muppet Treasure Island. Luckily, none<smdash/>count 'em, zero<smdash/>of
the Congressmen who supported the bills were Brown Alums. Fun fact, though: NINE of the bills'
supporters went to Harvard. I guess this confirms the theory that all Harvard grads are evil.
Instead of passing SOPA, here's some bills the Brown Band would like to endorse:

<sli>a)	The Repeal All Restraining Orders on Bands against Giant Drums Act, also known as
RAROBGDA;</sli>
<sli>b) The Spoiler Alert, Sugary Sodas Make You Fat Act, also known as SASSMYFA;</sli>
<sli>c)	The Mitch Hedberg Club Sandwich Club Regulation Act, also known as MHCSCRA;</sli>
<sli>d)	The Gondor-American Approved Aid Appropriations Act, also known as GAAAAA;</sli>
<sli>e)	The Brown University Tax Transfiguration System Extraordinaire, also known as
BUTTS-EX; and</sli>
<sli>f)	THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

Petition your Congressperson to sign these important bills today!

In the midst of all of this political rhetoric, we figured we'd take a minute to focus on the most
important presidential race of 2012, the great search for a replacement for Rutherford B.
Simmons, also known as Ruth Simmons. Right now it's a tight race between Cubby and Gail,
and nobody is sure who will win. However, a recent poll conducted by Bennington, Petts, and
Blumenthal shows that United Russia is in the lead with 120%. Gail was the first to go negative,
attacking Cubby for keeping silent on the important issues... literally, because he can't talk.
Cubby replied by shaking his fist and mounting a smear campaign against his opponent, calling
her soft on foreign immigration issues. We'll see who ends up on top after the debate this
Tuesday. Personally, we're rooting for Herman Cain.

Because this is our final ice show of the season, we'd like to take the time to thank our seniors
for being so, so baller. Band wouldn't be the same without Andrea, Benny G, BLeib, Brandon,
DStern, Jeff, Jessica, Justin, Leber, Maggie, and Monica. Also, thank you so much to all of our
super-awesome alums for coming back and skating with us! We love seeing you guys, and your
support means so much to us. Fans, thanks for coming out! We'll see you guys on the flipside.
Good night and good puck.
