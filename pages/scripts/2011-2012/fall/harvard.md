## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that puts the [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] it’s the Brown University “30 minutes or more, we’ll still take it!!” BAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNND!

Hello, everyone! We’re just as surprised to be here as you are! The Brown Band has quite a history of missing our pregame show due to horrifying Boston traffic and parking difficulties in HAHVAHD YAHD... but we managed to get here on time this year. So I’m going to wing it and tell my funniest Harvard jokes. People at Harvard are ugly. They stole their mascot from Alabama! ROLL TIDE! Harvard men are really tough; they know how to knit and stuff. Harvard women don’t exist because Harvard is sexist. How many Harvard students does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Five, because they’re ugly! A Harvard man walks into a bar. Everyone starts crying.

I guess I’ll just talk about this great movie I saw over the summer. Once upon a time there was a math whiz from Southie, a bank robber from Charlestown and an Irish mobster, also from Southie. One day, the Irish mobster decided to induct the math whiz into the mob by making him go undercover in the Massachusetts state police. As the math whiz balances basic training at police academy and algorithms at MIT, the mobster breaks the whiz’s ahm for wasting his time. One day, while attending a game at Fenway Pahk, the whiz notices a bank robber, the one from Charlestown, trying to rob the stadium. The whiz feels obligated to stop the robbery, but the mobster threatens to break his other ahm if he does, because the mobster has a stake in the robbery. But the whiz pushes the mobster off a building, Mahky Mahk and the Funky Bunch shoot Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Renner got dressed up as a nun and then shot and Robin Williams helps the whiz catch the robber. When the whiz and the robber first see each other, they are instantly friends, and decide to write movies together. After initial success as screenwriters, they fade into the back as actors, and Sean Bean dies, Anthony Anderson too.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that was recently downgraded by Standard and Poor’s, it’s the Brown University “now we’re just poor!” BAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNND!

Speaking of money, did you guys hear about how rich the Harvard Band is? We as an organization were recently informed that the Harvard Band is RICH.

In fact, on a scale of Brown Band to a lot of money, the Harvard Band reaches a whopping eleven! Here are some that the Harvard Band can purchase with their vast quantities of dolla dolla billz y’all!

- B. A sophisticated security system to protect their abnormally large drum,
- C. A second Harvard Band to go to things the real band doesn’t feel like attending,
- D. More money,
- E. The Federal Reserve, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

But enough about our abject poverty. Here’s what Brown’s Department of Archaeology did over the summer: found water on the moon for the eighth time, found Waldo and Amelia Earhart and Jimmy Hoffa and D.B. Cooper and Balloon Boy and Bobby Fisher, found Atlantis, found the Ark of the Covenant, found themselves, found the Holy Grail, and they also killed Nazis. Oh, here’s what our best friends at Yale University did over the summer: figured out how to revive aging brains and make them more youthful, and discovered new clues to the genetic roots of autism. And here’s what Harvard did over the summer: realized that drinking water instead of sugary sodas increases weight loss in children! We heard that next on their agenda is proving that water is wet and fire is hot! Keep up the good work, boys!

Watch now as the band plays “Come On, Harvard!” and forms a soda bottle angrily pointing at the Harvard band.

As we begin at Harvard, we commit to upholding the values of the College and to making the entryway and Yard a place where all can thrive and where the exercise of kindness holds a place on a par with intellectual attainment. SEXUALLY.
