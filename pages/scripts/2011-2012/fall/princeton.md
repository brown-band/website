## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's taking the Hobbits to Isengard, it's the Brown University "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!!" BBBAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDD!

A long time ago, in an Earth Middle, Middle Away...

The story takes place in the context of historical events in North-West Middle-earth. The South of Middle-earth, on the other hand, was enjoying an era of relative peace and prosperity. The novel begins in Western Massachusetts, as Brodo Baggins inherits the Ring from Gbagbo, recently deposed leader of the Shivory Coast. Both are unaware of its origin, but Wayne Gretzky, a wizard and former hockey coach of Gbagbo, learns of the Ring's history and advises Brodo to take it away from the Shire. Brodo leaves, taking his French maid and friend, Samwise ("Sam") Gamgee, and two concubines, Meriadoc ("Macho Man") Brandybuck and Peregrin ("Soulja Boy") Took, as companions.

Fast forwarding enough, but not fast enough that we miss the death of Sean Bean, Adrien Brody suddenly appears, struggles with Brodo for the Ring and bites off Brodo's finger, Ring and all. However in doing so he falls into the fire, taking the Ring with him, and the One Ring is thus destroyed. In the instant of its destruction, Sauron perishes, there is a sexy party, and everyone goes to Vegas. The end.

Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Giant Flying Eagles have been made for radio, theatre, and film.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's so fresh it doesn't need to season its meat with the Princeton Rub, it's the Brown University "We Love to Barbecue!" BAAAAANNNNNNNNNNDDDDDD!

While doing some research on the history of Princeton University, the Brown Band discovered a class of stars greater than any other class to ever pass through the halls of the disgustingly endearing Nassau Coliseum. The Princeton Class of Aught'Seven contained such fine gentlemen as Carlton, Dr. Manhattan, Jack Donaghy, Bruce Wayne, Doogie Hauser, M.D., Fred Flintstone, and eight of the nine Nazgul. They wanted to join a fraternity, but Princeton University just disbanded all of them! Thank god the all-inclusive Eating Clubs are still around. Oh, wait.

By the way, welcome friends and family to Family Weekend 2011! Because students from ninety-three countries attend Brown University, the Office of Student Life contracted us to translate the phrase "Family Weekend" for all of our brethren from abroad. So, here we have Swahili, Icelandic, Azerbaijani, Macedonian, and Georgian:

Hello Mudda, Hello Fadda, here I am at ol' Brunonia. School is very educating, and they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining. Now I don't want this note to scare ya, but a flasher's in the area! And I met this cute girl Marty, but saw her with another guy at DTau's party. So take me home now, Mudda Fadda, take me home now, I hate Brunonia! Don't leave me in Providence town; I'm scared by the hipsters running around! Wait a minute, it stopped raining, and some knowledge I've been gaining! Family's here now, wow that's betta- Mudda, Fadda, kindly disregard this letter!
