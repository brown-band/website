## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that looks back on its childhood games fondly, it's the Brown University "Hasbro? I hardly know Bro!" BAAAAAAANNNNNNNDDDD!

Bienvenidos a la Universidad de Colombia. Donde? Colombia! Oh! We're so glad to be here that we brought a very special friend of ours along-Mr. Bucket!! Keggy's long lost Latin American cousin, Senor Bucket, has been a friend and ally of the Brown Band for years. Today we celebrate his passion and commitment to this organization by putting him to good use. :sd[Band actually starts to play Mr. Bucket.] Watch now as the band forms and plays Mr. Bucket.

:sd[Band forms Mr. Bucket and plays "Midnight Special".]

And now for something completely different... Wait, hang on, I'm receiving a call. Hello? Oh, no, that's terrible. Well folks, it seems that today will be the last time the Band ever rejoices in Senor Bucket, seeing as he seems to have a terminal bout of gingivitis. Here's his bucket list:

:::script-list

- A. Get punched by the Phoenix;
- B. Go on a date with Hungry Hungry Hippos;
- C. Win a fight against Handsome Dan;
- D. Make it off this campus without getting stabbed;
- E. Finish his degree at Brown by taking everything S/NC; and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Look, the Band is forming a B for Mr. Bucket and playing "Mr. Bucket Forevermore".

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentleman, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that :sd[whale noise], it's the Brown University ":sd[dolphin noise]" BAAAAAAANNNNNNDDDDD!!!

The Brown Band is happy to be here playing at Sea World. We've been on a nature binge recently, so it's a real joy to be able to observe the dolphins in their natural habitat. We were especially looking forward to seeing them jump through hoops in the Hudson, but, ohh, it seems they've missed. It's a shame; the hoop was only 20 yards away. Watch now as the band forms a hoop on fire and plays Centerfold.

:sd[Band forms Vork and plays "Centerfold".]

So, fellow whale watchers, how is your day going? Good? Ours is too. Oh my… this just in… we are not actually at Sea World… We seem to be at… Columbia. We're not sure how we got to South America so quickly, but I guess we tesseracted or something? So, if you can see in five dimensions, you're in for a real treat. Watch now as the Band forms a Tesseract and plays The Time Warp.

:sd[Band forms a Tesseract and plays "The Time Warp".]

Since we're at Columbia, we'd like to take the time to make something explicitly clear to you students: we are NOT your rivals. Sure, we're prettier and smarter and happier and our president is Ruth Simmons, but that doesn't mean that we want to get into petty arguments with you about whose school is better—we already know that it's ours. We will, however, accept Barnard's application if they'd like to be our rivals. Just not you, Columbia. It can never be you. Watch now as the band forms a B for "Best School Ever" and plays Columbia, You Will Never Be Our Rival!

:sd[Band forms a "B" and plays "In the Fray".]

In case you weren't aware, this is the last football game of the season! The Brown Band has really enjoyed its 2011 football season and would like to thank the football team and all the Brown fans for showing us such a good time. Come back to Providence with us as we stake our claim as the world's only Ice Skating Band during the Hockey Season. Go Bruno!! Brown Band out.

:sd[#1 is sung halfheartedly by the scriptreader as the band leaves the field.]
