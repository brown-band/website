## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s not observing the Sabbath or Yom Kippur right now, it’s the Brown University “I FEEL SO GUILTY” BAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDD!!!

I’m sure that you all are aware of what today is The Holiest of Holies, the Day of Atonement, and no we’re not talking about that movie with Kiera Knightely and James MacAvoy. It’s Yom Kippur! And for those of you who aren’t Jewish, it’s Fall Weekend! We’re that at this very moment, countless Brown students are either fasting or enjoying their long weekend, and we wish we could be, too! But, instead, we’re here, serving you noble football-goers as is our traditional Saturday custom. And y’all better feel honored; we’re missing some important business to be here! Seriously, the UN’s Security Council called, and it’s wondering why we’re not at the top-secret summit right now. Oops, that was supposed to be confidential. Hang on, United Nations, we’re on our way!

And now for something completely different, Storytime with Andrew Leber. :sd[In a Christopher Walken voice] Call me Ishmael. In a sense, I am Jacob Horner. Many years later, as I faced the firing squad, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was a bright, cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel. It was like so, but wasn’t. It was the day my grandmother exploded. All this happened, more or less. This is the saddest story I have ever heard.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization ranks itself number one in every survey ever taken, it’s the Brown University “Customer Satisfaction Guaranteed” BAAAAANNNNNDDDD!

Holy Cross is a fine, upstanding university, and apparently it’s ranked among U.S. News’ “Alumni’s Top 10 Most Loved Schools,” so we did some research regarding their alumni. We found out that Jon Favreau, the director of everyone’s favorite movies, Iron Man and Cowboys and Aliens, and the voice behind everyone’s favorite guinea pig from the spy action thriller G-Force, Hurley the Guinea Pig, is a Holy Cross alum! Isn’t that cool? \*pause\* Oh, wait, I have just been informed that the famous Hollywood Jon Favreau is actually not a Holy Cross alum; that one is Jon Favreau, President Obama’s speechwriter. Another famous Holy Cross alum is Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, notable for :sd[tongue clicks] being a Supreme Court Justice.

Watch now as the band forms a gavel, seriously, it’s a gavel, and plays “Beat It.”

By the way, who knows what’s going on with Via Via IV? When I was here as a freshman, everyone knew that Via Via IV was owned by the “Providence Neighborhood Association.” Then, I went away to Egypt and came back, and now it’s Cosa Nostra, owned by Italians but run by Egyptians. Then I go away again for the some and now it’s run by Syrians leasing from Egyptians but running it as a Middle Eastern joint called Prince. And then I go back and the Syrians have been evicted by the Egyptians for theft and now it’s back to the way it was? Does anyone even go there? Am I really the only person who buys the pizza? It’s good!

- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Join us next week as everyone and their grandmother descend upon Brown’s campus (literally!) for family weekend. Spoiler alert, it’s also homecoming! Be prepared to flaunt your Brown spirit as the Bears take on the Tigers, and no, don’t try to make the Wizard of Oz joke, we’ve heard it before.
