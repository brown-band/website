Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that :sd[Wilson Baer suddenly runs out first] oh my G-d -he just ran in- it's the Brown University "LEEROOOOYYYYYYYYYYY NNJJJJJENKINSSSSSSSSS" BAAAAANNNNDDD!

OK, uhh well what we'll do, I'll run in first, gather up all the eggs, we can kinda just, ya know, blast them all down with AOE- Uhh I think this is a pretty good plan, we should be able to pull it off this time.

Uhh, alright, you think we're ready guys? :sd[awesome voice] TIME'S UP, LET'S DO THIS!

:sd[Band forms an asterisk and plays "Crazy Train".]

Oh well, at least the Band has chicken. Speaking of chicken, established in 1924, the Brown University Band is one of Brown's oldest and most unique student organizations. Founded by Irving Harris, the band has successfully brought Brown's distinct tradition and music to every student that has walked through the Van Wickle Gates. In addition, the band continues to provide alumni with memories of their days at Brown. With an audience ranging from children to adults, the band manages to capture a smile from all while performing a wide variety of music. From athletic events to commencement ceremonies to the world's only ice skating band, the Brown University Band is the spirit of Brown.

And now for something completely different! Since he just became the boss of the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of Sabre, the band would like to share with you the wisdom of one of Cornell's most celebrated alumni, Andy "Nard Dog" Bernard:

:::script-list

- A. I get super flexible when I'm nervous,
- B. Got straight B's - they called me Buzz,
- C. I come from a line of WASPs so long it leads back to Moses,
- D. I got peepers of an eagle: CAAAAW!
- E. Andy Bernard does not lose contests, he wins them, or he quits them because they're unfair, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Watch now as the band forms a B and celebrates the fact that its alumnus associated with "The Office" is Jon Krasinski with "Brown Forevermore."

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization: The Brown University Band.

Watch now as the band makes a form and plays a song.

:sd[Band forms a moon and plays "Every Rose Has Its Thorn".]

ROLL TIDE! Next week on iCarly, the Brown Band returns to Providence and watches the Bears fight the Quakers. If that isn't an oxymoron, I don't know what is!
