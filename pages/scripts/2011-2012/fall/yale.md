## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that plans on flushing the Yale Bowl, it's the Brown University "This place is a DUMP!" BAAANANNANNANNANANNADDDDDD!

So everyone knows James Franco, the man, the myth, the legend. Everyone knows James Franco is an artiste, and everyone knows that James Franco is making his own Art Museum. Wait, you didn't know what? James Franco is making his own Art Museum: the James Franco Art Museum of Imaginary Art. And he's planning to auction off the following pieces of his priceless contribution to popular culture in order to fund this institution:

:::script-list

- A. An interpretive dance set to John Cage's "4:33";
- B. A painting of said interpretive dance;
- C. A 6-hour rock opera about General Hospital;
- D. A sculpture of Handsome Dan punching a lady in a bear suit;
- E. An imagined short film based on "Red Leaves" by William Faulkner, wait that's something he already did; and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

:::

Watch now as the band curates this collection of junk, celebrates the fact that it also gets to be televised today, and plays "NFL on Fox".

And now for something completely different, we're gonna talk about Yale's Alumni. They're a bunch of technologically innovative geniuses. For example, Eli Whitney 1809 invented the Cotton Gin, originally intended to extract Gin from Cotton. Samuel Morris, class of 1518, invented Telegraph Sex, the predecessor to Phone Sex. David Bushnell 332 BC invented the Screw Propeller and the Naval Mine, the two top-selling sex toys of all time. The first commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office—Henry Leavitt Ellsworth 2057, also went to Yale. Hmm, so Yale's alumni are all famous inventors but also Patent Office workers... Coincidence? The Band thinks not. Watch now as the band asks what you're wearing, stop, and plays an old standard on the Cotton Gin, stop.

## Halftime

Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears, presenting an organization that's come to bury Caesar, not to praise him, it's the Brown University "και συ, τεκνον?" BAAAAAAANNNNNNNDDDDD!!!

One dark and stormy night, Harvard Brutus, Caius Penn, and Trebonius, all wearing togas, convene on Pompey's porch to discuss the murder of Yale Caesar. Yale didn't know about the meeting—he was too busy denying the crown three times that was too big to fit on his overlarge head. Harvard wasn't the quite sure about the plan, but Penn was extra devious and wooed him to the dark side with cheesy letters, specifically gruyere. Watch now as the band forms a conspiracy and plays "Watch out, Caesar!"

:sd[Band forms the Leaning Tower of Pisa and plays "Joshua".]

Now it's the Ides of March, the sacred feast of Anna Perenna. Yale is walking along, minding its own business, when a staggeringly drunk Dartmouth starts soothsaying all over him. "Methinks you should beware the March of Ides, brah," Dartmouth warns, but the advice is a couple Ides too late. Suddenly, Harvard sneaks up from behind and knocks Yale dead with a thirty-foot bass drum. Penn and the other conspirators crowd around and begin to stab Yale, who utters his last words: "What the hell, Harvard?!? Then fall Caesar." Watch now as the band mourns an Ivy great and plays in iambic pentameter.

:sd[Band takes down Caesar forming a sword and plays "Pretty Fly".]

Brown Antony calls shenanigans. At Yale's funeral, he points out that Yale was just murdered by his ex-best friends and the Romans stood by and did nothing. Cornell Calpurnia, Yale's sunburned wife, sobbed heartbrokenly as Princeton Portia, Harvard's crazy wife, stood by and laughed. Brown vows permanent revenge against the conspirators, and runs off to get it on with Cleopatra after whooping their sorry asses in a fierce battle of fisticuffs. Columbia Cinna the Poet dies in the confusion, and Deep Springs Octavius Caesar takes control as the first emperor of Rome. Watch now as the band exits stage left and plays us off, Johnny!

:sd[Band forms a "B" and plays "#2".]

Next week, the Intrepidly Awesome Brown Band returns to Providence and watches Bruno smoke Dartmouth's Big Green. How will they do it? Maybe we'll take the Yale Bowl with us. Smell ya later!
