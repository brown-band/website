Oh well, at least the Band has chicken. Speaking of chicken, established in 1924, the Brown University Band is one of Brown's 
oldest and most unique student organizations. Founded by Irving Harris, the band has successfully brought Brown's distinct 
tradition and music to every student that has walked through the Van Wickle Gates. In addition, the band continues to provide 
alumni with memories of their days at Brown. With an audience ranging from children to adults, the band manages to capture a 
smile from all while performing a wide variety of music. From athletic events to commencement ceremonies to the world's only 
ice skating band, the Brown University Band is the spirit of Brown.
