Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just doesn’t know how to say goodbye,
it’s the Brown University “HOW CAN I LIVE WITHOUT YOU?” BAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDD?
</sp>

Watch now as the band forms a champagne flute and toasts its seniors, limerick-style.

Justin Ardini, CS Major <sbr/>
Pretty good at bari sax, we’d wager.<sbr/>
Haven’t seen him this year, <sbr/>
The band now sheds a tear. <sbr/>
Someone call him up on his pager!
</sp>
<sp>
There once was a bandie named Monica <sbr/>
Who played the bass drum, not harmonica <sbr/>
But in a decade or two <sbr/>
Who knows what she’ll do! <sbr/>
Perhaps she’ll produce electronica?
</sp>
<sp>
Beloved head conductor Benny G <sbr/>
Sometimes mullet-wearing is he. <sbr/>
We’re really big fans <sbr/>
Of his bandana tan. <sbr/>
And we feel bad for hitting him with keys!
</sp>
<sp>
O, Maggie “the awesomest!” Goter <sbr/>
We love her so much we’d promot’er! <sbr/>
She does her karate, <sbr/>
Oh damn what a hottie! <sbr/>
And she pleases all the tromboners.
</sp>
<sp>
There once was a grad student Brandon <sbr/>
Who played cymbals with reckless abandon <sbr/>
He drives a white Caddy <sbr/>
On his trips to the Ratty  <sbr/>
And as swaggest among us he’s standin’.
</sp>
<sp>
Where there’s a bass drum, there’s Jess <sbr/>
Keeps percussion from being a mess <sbr/>
What a pretty face! <sbr/>
Always brightens this place! <sbr/>
We will miss her, we must now profess.
</sp>
<sp>
Our scriptreader Andrew Leber <sbr/>
Has a voice that’s better than Bieber <sbr/>
Always lending a hand <sbr/>
To help out the band <sbr/>
He really is quite the achiever.
</sp>
<sp>
A senior snare player Ben Leib <sbr/>
Never ever looks like a dweeb <sbr/>
His hair is well-coiffed, <sbr/>
1-2, screw it it roll off <sbr/>
More majestic than a great crested grebe (it’s a bird!)
</sp>
<sp>
David Stern, our friendly historian, <sbr/>
Is wise as an elf from Lothlorien <sbr/>
Passion never lacks <sbr/>
When he plays his sax. <sbr/>
He sure wishes he drove a dolorian!
</sp>
<sp>
Ohh Andrea Weber, she climbs rocks! <sbr/>
Just look at her, what a fine stone cold fox! <sbr/>
The best president of the Band <sbr/>
In the entire land, <sbr/>
She keeps closed the Band’s Pandora’s Box.

Seniors, we love you! But the fun's not over just yet - stay tuned for more cool jokes and hilarious tunes at halftime!

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants to occupy your Wall Street, it’s the Brown
University “Our favorite kind of milk is 1%!” BAAANNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD! Just in case anyone here has been living
under a rock for the past two months, there’s thing called Occupy Wall Street going on in New York City and also everywhere
else in the world. The protesters are anti-money, swag, bears, robots, food, blankets, penicillin, and hot chocolate.
However, they are pro-dreadlocks, bikes, and spirit fingers. What kind of new world will emerge from all of this progress?
The band’s puttin’ their money on a dystopia. Watch now as the band forms a dystopia and plays “Sir Duke”.

A long time ago, in a 2006 far away, the Battle for Dartmouth raged on in Hanover, New Hampshire. The Bro Guys, led by Keggy
Wan Kenobi and his expert command of the Farce, were hot on the trail of Darth Moose and his Death Keystone. The school’s
administration favored Darth Moose, not solely because of how similar to Dartmouth his name sounds, but Keggy Wan Kenobi’s
campaign of Liberty and Beirut for All was much more appealing to the students. The battle ended in a stalemate, and thus
The Big Green was born. But we’re still wondering… what exactly is the Big Green? Tune in next time for Dart Mouths Episode
VII, A New Color.

Watch now as the band forms a B for Brown Not Dartmouth and plays "Brown, Not Dartmouth, Man Born".

This is actually our last home game of the season, seeing as next week we’re travelling to Columbia. Yeah, we don’t know where
that is either. In light of this fact, we’d like to thank the fans here at home and the Brown University administration—especially
you, President Simmons!—for their continued support. Seniors, we love you!! Band, out.
