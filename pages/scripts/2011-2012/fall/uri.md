## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that still hasn’t figured out what URI stands for, it’s the Brown University “Thank You, Disambiguation Page,” BAAAANNNNNDDDDDD!

This year, when we heard that we were playing URI, we weren’t quite sure what our athletic department was talking about. So, we turned to our trusted friend Wikipedia and found some interesting answers. Tonight is a faceoff between Bruno and the Fightin’ Armenian Cucumbers! Or, maybe we’re playing against a political party in South Korea. Oh no! We all just caught upper respiratory tract infections! Hang on, these all seem false... Did any of these have citations?

We’re sure that you are all well aware of the bitter rivalry between URI and Brown-we fight to the death every year for the possession of the prized Governor’s Cup. Little did you know, however, that there are some prizes that are way more exciting than a simple Cup. They are...

And now, for something completely different, watch as the Band forms a B and plays “In the Fray!”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that after 87 years has yet to attain tenure, it’s the Brown University “Our Research Didn’t Get Funded!!!” BAAAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDD!

Welcome to Brown University, a school with a faculty as diverse as its student body! When walking around campus, you’ll see all types of professors–your Engineering Bros rockin’ out to Green’s Theorem, the Medieval Studies LARPers working studiously on their ComicCon costumes, some COE Jocks tossin’ around the ol’ pigskin, the MCM Hipsters having a glare-off with the VISA Hipsters through their black-rimmed glasses (though we all know LitArts is the most hipster of them all)... Yeah, we know it seems like a lot, but, as with everything else here, being a professor is a spectrum!

:sd[Band forms hipster glasses and plays “Johnny B. Goode”.]

Our beloved faculty gave us waaayyy too much homework for us to actually write a whole script, so we decided the second halftime paragraph would take the fall.

Watch as the band stops writing its CompLit essay, thinks fondly about the free time it once had, and plays “I Want You Back”.

:sd[Band forms the Brown logo and plays “I Want You Back”.]

And now, the band would like to recognize everyone’s favorite University President, Dr. Ruth Simmons. Ruth Simmons can win a game of chess by saying “Yahtzee”. Did you know Ruth Simmons had a role in Star Wars? She was the Force. When Ruth Simmons rides into the sunset, the sun is actually running from her. Some magicians can walk on water; Ruth Simmons can swim through land. Ruth Simmons rides a Brown Bear being pulled by another Brown Bear to work every day. And, lastly, Ruth Simmons has served the University for eleven years, leading us to glory for all of them. So thank you, President Simmons, for enriching our lives as Brown students and for everything you’ve contributed to Brown as a university!

:sd[Band forms a B and plays “Brown Three-evermore”.]

Seriously, we can’t stress enough how great all of our faculty and staff are, and especially how lucky we’ve been to have Ruth Simmons as our president. Oh, URI, are you guys still here? We forgot about you in our Brunonian lovefest. Fans, stop by next week as Bruno takes on the Holy Cross Crusaders. 12th century Middle East, here we come!
