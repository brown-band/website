## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’ll crack your liberty bell, it’s the Brown University “So Bunker Hill I did!” BAAAANNNNNNDDDDD!

Once upon a time, more specifically in 1776, the glorious city of Philadelphia was enjoying fabulous success. It was the capital city of the newly formed United States of America, it was the biggest city out of all thirteen colonies, and it was the seat of liberty: both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States were signed there. Ben Franklin ruled the city with a less-than-iron fist, preferring wild fiestas to cultural edification, and boy were those Amish people stylish and nice! Watch now as the band forms a Liberty Bell and wishes it could go revisit those glory days with “Thriller”.

Fast forward to 2011, and Philly’s not doing so hot. In 1793, Yellow Fever raged throughout the city and obliterated a ninth of the city’s residents. Things only went downhill from there, and now there are 302 murders and/or nonnegligent manslaughters per day in the supposed “City of Brotherly Love.” Philly is one of the most obese cities in the world, perhaps due to their extreme consumption of their famous cheesesteaks, and M. Night Shyamalan often bases his movies there. Uh oh, looks like we extolled Philly’s virtues too soon. Watch now as the band appreciates Providence by forming a B and playing “Brown Bear”.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that didn’t know they made masks that ugly, it’s the Brown University “Nice costumes, Penn!” BAAAANNNNNNDDDD!

According to our very thorough research, Penn University is known for its crazy All Hallows Eve traditions. The students escape from their dorms, also known as the sewer systems of Philadelphia, and terrorize the city. They go on scavenger hunts that get so extreme, there have been several notable instances of Penn students literally climbin’ in yo’ windows and snatchin’ yo’ people up because they were refused candy. They’ve been known to scare little children with or without their costumes on and many are forced to spend a night in the slammer because of general skullduggery. Boy, the Brown Band is glad that we don’t go to UPenn, and bets the students there wish they could Time Warp back to before they applied!

And now for something completely different, the Brown Band would like to extend a warm welcome to Penn University’s newest class of freshmen, Penn ’15. We heard that you all were the most diverse class that the University has ever accepted, so we thought we’d take a stab at all of the cool things you guys accomplished in your pre-college lives:

:::script-list

- A. One of you guys founded the writing utensil wholesaling website Pen Island.com;
- B. Apparently that guy in your pass/fail business management class was the captain of his high school football team, The Lincoln High School Trojans;
- C. Your hot hipster girlfriend is in the process of directing a remake of that famous 1970’s film “Shaft”;
- D. In your high school nanomaterials lab, your group successfully created the world’s smallest structure made out Erector Sets;
- E. That cute girl who you saw across the dining hall that one time used to hand out hot wieners to the homeless; and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Watch now as the band celebrates your extensive talents by forming Lincoln and playing the Ding Dong Song.

Next week, the Brown Band heads to Yale University to cheer on Grand Ole Bruno as the team flushes the Yale Bowl! Can’t wait to see you in New Haven, where everything looks better in the dark.
