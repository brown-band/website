## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting and organization that’s more upper class than a frilly cravat, it’s the Brown University “Four more years! Four more years!” BAND!

[Band forms champagne flute, plays “Bits and Pieces”]

The spiritual leader of the trombones is Joe\
Who’s enthusiastic wherever we go\
His ambivalence towards clothes\
Has provoked many “whoas”\
When he leaves we’ll miss that special glow.

The baritone section’s a rock\
Due to our favorite citizen of Bangkok\
You can’t predict Por’s quantum state\
That’s why I still don’t have a date\
But tomorrow night I’ll show her my problem set.

Mike Romito, one of two conductor lame ducks\
Alas we’ll hear no more “St. Louis Sucks”\
Whether playing tuba or trombone\
He will still to check his phone\
For IM sports he likes footballs and hockey pucks.

Our old VP from Jersey has large ears\
Pfeff’s sass has been a band staple for years.\
Only once in a blue moon\
Has he come to practice too soon\
But he’s never made us cry our puppy tears.

That crazy dancing man’s from Michigan\
And though, and though we may wish again\
We may never see the moves\
Of a section leader’s grooves\
Schuyler’s dance shook up the crowd in Penn

Matt Sarasin is a speedy conductor\
And for 3 years has been a leader\
While he flails his arms and sings\
We know what his accent brings:\
I sawr a horrible orange coffeemilk idear cah.

Ed, our whistle-blower clarinet\
Was moneygod for a year, and didn’t incur any debt\
To start cheers you can thank he\
When the ref drops his hanky\
We all envy his financial security net.

Here’s to Liz Winograd-Cort\
Our fave Wind Symphony import\
When she leaves ADPhi\
It’ll be a sad goodbye\
But we hope to get more of her sort.

Alida puts the M in our alto-tenor sections\
Her quiet presence has led the band in the right directions\
When she visited down under\
The whole band was torn asunder\
But now she gives us all large dinners.

In Italy Lexie had quite a good time\
Surrounded by men, pasta, and wine\
From Chicago she has come\
To make the first-years succumb\
While calling out “Oh Lexie be mine!”

For WBRU he’s Adam Saks\
And his voice makes up for what his height lacks\
He should’ve gone in ’03\
But we’ll be happy to see\
Him inevitably in ‘06 come back

Caitlin’s our history source\
Clarineting for her is par for the course\
As a mom she prevented scars\
As a pirate she ARR’s\
Her intellect to be reckoned with is a force.

As prez, Tyler committed no sin\
And with him as our captain we always win\
He’ll fix computers without a sigh\
And overall he’s a great guy\
But we’re kind of creeped out by his twin.

Here’s to our vice president Leigh\
Who’s reflected on what it is to be\
The beer she decants\
Comes straight from “My Pants”\
After she cruises on her Segway yelling “EEEEEE!”

Former Prez Leah plays flute\
She lost Mike P on the Penn route\
Her rhythm’s circadian\
She’s our token Canadian\
We’ll be glum when the Gates she’s gone oot.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that invites you to stuff its body cavity, it’s the Brown University, “Baster? I hardly know ‘er!” BAND!

As midterms subside, the Band has begun to ponder what it must have actually been like at the first Thanksgiving dinner. We’re sure it started off on the right foot, as everyone feasted on wild turkey, Franzia, magic bars, and Easy Mac. However, things likely got awkward when Squanto showed up with William Bradford’s daughter, and everyone found out that Chief Massassoit was actually a vegan. If there’s one lesson to be learned here, though, it’s this: If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach him how to fish, he’ll spread infectious disease throughout your people and trade you control of your homeland for a few shiny beads. Watch now as the band takes a Time Warp back to the old days, forms its favorite harvest beverage, and declares, “Wampum? I hardly know ‘em!”

[Band forms cider, plays “Time Warp”]

We’ve also been thinking about things we can share around the holiday table, and have come up with the following things for which we are thankful:

:::script-list

- A) That Brown’s not in Harlem
- B) That Brown’s not in Ithaca
- C) That Brown’s not in Cambridge
- D) That Brown’s not in Hanover
- E) That Brown’s not in New Haven
- F) The Princeton Band

:::

No matter what your location, though, many agree that while stuffing is good in the box, other things are better in the can. Watch now as the Band maintains its cylindrical shape and plays “You Can Call Me gALatinous.”

:sd[Band forms cylinder, plays “You Can Call Me Al”]

After a tryptofantastic meal, some families like to challenge each other to board games like Scrabble, which is why this year, we’re especially thankful that Brown has the highest consonant-to-vowel ratio in the Ivy League. And when it comes time for the annual inter-Ivy Scrabble tournament, though Harvard’s letters add up to the most points, they’re too proper for their own good and are ultimately useless. The band will now form a B for “Brown counts because it’s an adjective” while our seniors, wrapping up their last halftime show, wish that they could remain at Brown Forevermore.

:sd[Band forms B, plays #3]

This concludes the final show of the season. As we say goodbye to the class of ’05 who are already developing a fine layer of crust, our scriptwriter would like to remind all those in attendance that she is Philosophy major with excellent writing and organizational skills, and is currently available for employment. Please report to the band’s seating area with any inquiries or offers.
