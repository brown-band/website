## Pregame

To kick off another fine season, the Bears are joined today by the Great Danes of Albany: the city that always sleeps. To overcome recent New York budget deficits, half of Albany’s team has been outsourced to SUNY Geneseo, where they’ve formed a less filling squad, Genesee Light. The team’s traditional uniform tights will soon be replaced by more economical hotpants. The deficit has turned the university into a real Albaneezer Scrooge, tying purse strings around these dogs’ equipment so tightly, they’re rendered unable to score. Watch now as the band turns and coughs up something furry while playing “Championship.”

Recently voted the #1 party school in the U.S., Albany has spent the past year beefing up its social scene. With the implementation of a new EZ Pass grading system, students are now able to spend even less time studying and more time at those new-fangled moving pictures just introduced to the capital region known as Patalkies. Due to the rank odor wafting down the MassPike, we’re beginning to suspect there’s more than just water flowing through the Hudson Valley. The Band will form a B for “Beerie Canal” and play “Bring the Victory.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization with the most pipes in the Ivy League, it’s the Brown University “Organ Grinder? I hardly know ‘er!” BAND!

Since we’ve been away, the campus has seen more change than a Thayer Street hobo. The Brown Cosmonaut Society is thrilled by the new satellite anti-gravity fitness centers. Sadly, as the donkey photo has been removed from the SciLi, students will now actually have to go to German class to learn about Das Boat. Most importantly, all Class F parties must now be held in University facilities. While this means that security guards on Wriston will be reduced to watching over the Damascus truck, we’re sure we’ll be able to funnel some fun down through the Sayles Organ. The band will now form its favorite nighttime snack and play “EMS, I want you back.”

Some of the most notable changes are also the tastiest ones. However, until the new Jagermeister Wellness Center opens up, we’ll have to spend meal credit on BUDS. Now that they’re open late, students have been seen blazing through an entire Gate pizza at 2AM. While we’re in a white haze of joy over the reappearance of poppyseed bagels, it’d be nice to see something other than mushrooms at the salad bars. Stuck in the line for brownies, the band asks, “Why doesn’t Smoothie King take points?”

Traffic through the Ratty has been amended by the addition of giant street signs. In Accent Alley, you can add a hint of Cockney to your salad; at the Creation Station, let there be light dressing. The rest of the U. has followed suit and has renamed roads on the East Side to make navigation easier. For instance, at the corner of Mythical and Not-In-This-Lifetime Streets, you can find Brown’s new performance hall and plenty of overnight street parking. Please be aware, however, that Tee-Wat Way, typically accessible by a narrow, tree-lined service road, will be closed once a month for periodic maintenance. Sick of this structure being obscured by shrubbery, the band will plow through the bush and play “In the Way.”

We’d like to remind you that tomorrow is National Talk Like a Pirate Day, and invite you to join us here next week to take on Harrrrrrrvard.
