## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that prefers not to swallow what it’s chewing, it’s the Brown University “That’ll stay in your stomach for 7 years!” BAND

According to this year’s impeccably researched US News list, Brown has risen in esteem since last year, but Cornell came in dead last among the Ivy League schools. This confirms what Brown students have known for years: that Cornell sinks to the bottom because its students are much denser than the rest of us. Leading the exodus out of low standing, the band will part the red sea and play “NFL on Fox.”

Though many have been loyal Big Red fans for years, the school’s recent decline in popularity correlates with a demand for a much less rigid stick to chew on. Four out of five Brown Band members agree: Precision and pretension go hand in hand. Since we forgot to brush up our forms, we will scramble to switch to Trident , form the instrument that keeps Cornell’s fancy hats up tight and play “Brown Forevermore.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, Alumni, and mooching roommates, presenting an organization that knows it might be wrong, it’s the Brown University “Who’s your daddy?” BAND!

Band members had to do a little cleanup in preparation for the arrival of our parents. For instance, now that we have company, we have to remember to actually put our pants on as we leave, rather than just using them to block the draft under the door. We also have to remember to empty the recycle bin and clean off the hard drive before admitting exiled family members. Forming a Do Not Enter sign, the band will sock it to you, and ask that you Respect its privacy.

This is the time of year when the extremely lifelike roommate should get stored under the bed and the real roommate emerges looking for handouts. Though some students might feel inconvenienced by their family’s demands on their time, there’s certainly always someone willing to take advantage of parental assets. We do appreciate the distance some relatives have traveled to see us, whether it’s from Milford, Connecticut or Milford, Nebraska. Forming a symbol of our affection, the band will continue to develop its Oedipus complex and get it goin’ on.

After this weekend, it will be difficult to return to the frugal college student lifestyle. We’ve gotten used to the comforts of fine foods like magic bars made with real fairy dust and wine from an actual bottle. In fact, at this point in the show, the band would like to sponsor its own halftime contest: Whichever parent can throw his or her credit card closest to the sousaphone wins! Forming a B for the inevitable return to vegan brown rice pilaf the band will play Brown Man Born.

Next week this happy bunch of idiots –finally through with New York teams- will take its lucky midget to UPenn and schmear ourselves all over Philly.
