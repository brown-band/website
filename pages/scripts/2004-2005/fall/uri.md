## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that didn’t quite make it to Foxwoods, it’s the Brown University “Meet me at…the Wakefield Rotary Club?” BAND!

The band left its Providential bubble today to seek the cup of our governor, Rhode Island’s own Wizid of Ahs, Keepah of misplaced consonants. We’d like to take this opportunity to remind URI that though they currently have the cup, Brown still has the governor. We’re certain his Brown education will help him beat back such political abominations as the proposed West Warwick casino and Patrick Kennedy’s hair. The band will motion to keep eyesores and compulsive gamblers in Connecticut where they belong and play “Time Warp.”

As usual, Kingston has been a hotbed of controversy over the past few weeks. The University is suffering from a devastating parking shortage due to a drastic escalation in the number of students driving their tractors to campus. With any luck, the implementation of subsidized hayrides should alleviate this problem. Next time, the band will remember to just park our bus in Cranston and walk the rest of the way while we take in the Longview of the state.

In addition to the parking shortage, lack of funding is always a matter for concern. Despite attracting big-name acts, the immense Ryan Center is failing to pay for itself, as it turns out that Ludacris does not in fact have the cash flow to make your booty go _smack._ The band will fill Ryan’s center with sweet, chewy nougat while forming a B and playing “Brown Forevermore.”

Though the Bears will colonize the Bronx on Columbus day weekend, the Band will leave its cultural dominance and infectious diseases at home. We’ll return on the 16th to bring a pox upon Princeton.
