## Pregame

Contrary to popular belief, some Dartmouth students have recently asserted that there are in fact no sheep in The Big Green, and vice versa. We believe, however, that they’ve just headed south and can probably be found in Daytona Beach participating in wet wool contests and shearing themselves for the camera. The band, with Snoop Dogg, will follow them there to judge the “Championship.”

:sd[Dissonant chord pulse] This is a band. :sd[chord] This stadium is conducting a test of the emergency band system. :sd[chord] This is _only_ a band. :sd[chord] This is a test of the emergency band system. :sd[chord] The broadcasters in the area, in compliance with Federal, State, and local authorities, have developed this system to keep you entertained in the event of an emergency. :sd[chord] If this had been an actual PreGame show, the attention signal you just heard would have been followed by official hilarity, innuendo, and sheep jokes. :sd[chord] This band serves the greater northeast area. :sd[chord] This concludes the test of the emergency band system.

And now back to your regularly scheduled “Brown Cheering Song.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that’s presenting, it’s the Brown University “Baby got baaaaack!!!” BAND!

\*Beep\* \*Kachunk\* The Brown Band has prepared a special slide show on indigenous life forms in Hanover. Apparently, Dartmouth was originally founded for the education of the youth of Indian tribes, which roamed wild and free across Hanover’s plains, peacefully existing with a race of giant English-speaking, long-lashed, blue-eyeshadow wearing sheep. Occasionally, these creatures were even featured in the creases of Pueblo Magazine. However, this caused strife between them and local Navajos, and eventually, the latter group was relegated to patrolling Foxwoods for work. Watch now as the band forms a latex alternative and plays “Pretty Fly for a White Guy”

:sd[Band forms sheep intestine, plays “Pretty Fly”]

Next slide, please! \*Beep\* \*Kachunk\* As Dartmouth students began to trickle into Hanover, the native people had to find ways to survive. For instance, they created entertainment able to be viewed by everyone and traveled the countryside performing as adobe acrobats. Unfortunately, both the tribes and giant sheep have been gradually picked off by birds of pray. This situation gave rise to the inspirational sound for Dartmouth’s motto, “A Voice Crying in the Wilderness,” and lead us to realize that they’ve got Mo’ hawk, mo’ problems. Watch as the band does its best to defend itself from the Woolly Bully.

:sd[Band forms shotgun, plays “Woolly Bully”]

Next slide, please! \*Beep\* \*Kachunk\* This brief history now leads us up to the time of year when the remaining local ewes begin to have aspirations of asylum with human company to assuage the cold of the impending winter nights. An astounding number of Dartmouth students assemble assiduously to make these associations. There’s often an assortment of animals that need protection from winter’s asperity, and indeed, many students can be found astride multiple in order to assist. Always willing to lend a hand, members of the Big Green will soon be asking, “Ascertain? How can I choose?” Assuming nothing goes asunder, the Band will form B to assert that Both animals and humans will soon be able to stay warm with a roll In the Hay.

:sd[Band forms B, plays In the Fray]

\*Beep\* \*Kachunk\* Leaving pieces of tongue on every flagpole in Hanover, the band will return home next week for the last game of the season against Columbia. :sd[Band: “Where?”] Home.
