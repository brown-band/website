## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that put its Big 10 in the Happy Valley, it’s the Brown University “We’ve got your Beaver Stadium right here!” BAND!

The band is thrilled to be here in State College today, to finally take on a school that excels in both athletics and academics. Though we have no idea what a Nittany is, we hope to put in a more impressive performance than the Iowa Hawkeyes, who managed to drop the Lions’ record to 2 and 5. Commemorating last week’s game that had less drive than an ‘83 Buick, the band will play “25 or 6 to 4.”

Apparently, PSU was originally started as a high school, but – Um, yes? Excuse me one second… I’m sorry, what? We’re where?...but our schedule says “Penn”…It didn’t used to be a high school?...oh…This is still Brown, right?...Well that’s a relief… Sorry about that. The band will form a B for “Go Buckeyes!” and be thankful that it’s still a Brown Man Born.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that’s still taking candy from strangers, it’s the Brown University “Twizzler? I hardly know ‘er!” BAND!

Though the band is still putting the final stitches in its Curt Schilling’s Tendon costume, we’re sure Philadelphia is well-prepared for Halloween. We’ve even heard that Penn’s new president, Amy Gutmann, is masquerading as Brown’s president, Ruth Simmons. While we’re in town, this New England organization thought it’d be nice to take advantage of All Hallow’s Eve by vandalizing Pete Rose’s house, but that might be a bit of a gamble. The band will now form its favorite method of demonstration and Beat It.

It’s great to be in Pennsylvania during election season since it’s such a swingin’ state. We’re concerned about the way it’s leaning, though. Fuel prices have been lowered since, with all that cheesesteak consumption, gas production is at an all-time high. We hope Philly will use its brotherly love to help the country switch partners while we form 3 more days and help it swing with “Hey Pachuco.”

We don’t want to let Halloween festivities stop us from seeing the tourist attractions, but we’re afraid that if we drop off our keys at Ben Franklin’s party, we may never see them again. While we’re here, we’ll also make sure that the Liberty Bell’s not the only thing going “bong!” in the night. When we go downtown, we’ll be sure to pay special attention to its strokes. Clearing out throats, the band will form a B for “Bagels on Ricola, Bagels on Halls” and play “Bring the Victory.”

Having been initiated into the Penn 15 club, the Band will make its way back to Providence to defend the homeland against Yale.
