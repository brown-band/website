## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that doesn’t need any wood, it’s the Brown University “Flip-flopper? I hardly know ‘er!” BAND!

The recent presidential debates have caused the band to question just how we differ from the Princeton band. We’ve been considering a series of similar debates to let the world know exactly where we stand on such issues as Birkenstocks vs. boat shoes and American’s Polo Collars: Up or Down? The Band will argue its case and play “Championship.”

Though there likely will be much dissent between the two schools, we’re both sure to agree on one necessity: Kicking Dartmouth out of the Ivy League. Though this may elicit cries of “Don’t forget Penn!,” the Band will form a B for “Bring it on” and play “In the Fray.”

## Halftime

We recently read that Princeton has decided to do away with its residential Minority Affairs Advising program. Apparently, in the eyes of the tigers, this program just isn’t a survivor. The university will now be able to concentrate its funding elsewhere, such as sponsoring a needy foreign child for less than 2 dollars a day. Making Sally Struthers proud, the Band will shake its Djibouti and give up the funk.

Beginning next summer, Princeton will reopen the doors of its Woodrow Wilson School’s Junior Summer Institute to everyone, though the program was previously suspended out of fear of anti-affirmative action lawsuits. We’d like to commend Princeton on its efforts to diversify; we’re proud to finally see them considering the needs of its privileged white students. Watch now as the Band unpacks its invisible knapsack and play “Hey, ya finally did it!”

But why stop there? The University has proposed several other ways to promote heterogeneity in its population, including:

:::script-list

- A) Replace its mascot with the Zebra from Fruit Stripe Gum
- B) Finally admit Carlton Banks
- C) Create a satellite campus in Newark
- D) Offer meal options compatible with the Southside diet
- E) Replace Nassau Hall with an adobe hut
- F) The Princeton Band

Forming its choice, the Band will play “Brown Cheering Song”

After the game, the band will hop onto its Segway and cry “eeeeee” all the way home for next week’s Homecoming against Cornell.
