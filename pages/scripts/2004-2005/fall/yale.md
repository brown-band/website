## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that didn’t know what to do so it just did a hoe-down, live from Providence, it’s the Brown University “Why don’t you blame it on the rain?” BAND!

We’ve got a great show for you today, folks, it’s really a pleasure to be here. The Yale Bulldogs are here :sd[sparse clapping]. The Brown Bears are here :sd[applause], the cheerleaders are here :sd[wild cheering]. We’ve even got the Brown Band :sd[applause]! Right now, they’re going to update the weekend by forming a football and playing “Brown Forevermore.”

:sd[Band forms football, plays #4]

Next, the Band would like to perform a track off of its new album. It’s a medley of songs from Jewel, Joni Mitchell, Ashlee Simpson, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacres entitled “Pieces of Us.” Watch as we form a B for “Believe us: _Never. Blame. It. On. The. Band._”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that’s no longer part of a reality-based community, it’s the Brown University “Blitzer? I hardly know ‘er!” BAND!

Unfortunately, we had to write today’s halftime show before any official election results could be released, but we know it will be a sad week for Yale University. No matter the outcome, a Yalie will have lost the presidential race for only the second time since 1876’s hotly-contested race between Samuel Tilden (Yale class of 1837) and Rutherford B. Hayes (Uncle Wheatly’s House of Beards, class of 1841). In any case, the band will turn our show – like the country – completely bass ackwards and play “Bring the Victory.”

:sd[Band forms B, plays “Bring the Victory”]

No matter who wins the election, he will be given the daunting task of reuniting a divided country. Both parties’ plans for healing the nation can be summed up in two words: Slumber Party!!! The Kerry camp has planned a lively, if ironic, game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey, which will immediately be followed by a Teresa Heinz-Kerry-conducted séance. However, things are expected to get a little awkward when John Edwards dons women’s clothing and insists that everyone address him as if he were British royalty. The band will now form a pair of house slippers and play “Johnny’s Queen Mumbo”

:sd[Band forms flip-flop, plays “Johnny’s Mambo”]

We imagine the scene would be slightly different given a victory for George Bush. When everyone’s through teasing John Ashcroft about his footie pajamas, the twins will likely propose a round of Spin the Bottle, which sounds like a good idea until it becomes apparent that Dick Cheney kisses like an old sponge. Fed up with being asked to show off our bipartisan relations, we’ll turn into a Bolivian marching band and take a trip to the oval bathroom. Celebrating this election the only way the president knows how, the band will start the Final Countdown to ’08.

:sd[Band disappears into black holes of optimism, plays “Final Countdown”]

Next week, the band will travel to Dartmouth, which is halfway between Canada and :break[aaaaggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh]{hyphens}!
