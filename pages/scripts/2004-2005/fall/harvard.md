## Pregame

Due to the sacred nature of this day, the band is unwilling to spell the full name of G-d on the field. In fact, out of respect, the entire first half will be played without the use of the letter O, which should make for an interesting game of ftball. Though some of the band is off fasting like an Olsen twin, the rest of us will try to win one for the Kippur by leaving the pigskin intact and playing “NFL on Fox.”

Brown’s campaign to victory over Harvard today is slightly marred by the arrival of the Boston Duck Boat Veterans for Truth who have traveled over land and water to insist that last week’s triumph over Albany wasn’t as heroic as it seems. However, we know these boys from Beantown are just blowing gas. The band will form a B for “Beans, beans, the musical fruit” and toot out “Brown Cheering Song.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that comes in Light, Regular, Heavy, Super, and Cool Ranch, it’s the Brown University “You can’t gargle sand” BAND!

Harvard students returned this fall to find a number of changes to their school’s regular cycle. Traffic in and out of Cambridge was frustrated due to the increased flow of Crimson through Boston’s new tunnel. Also, we’ve heard rumors that Home Depot made a large contribution to Harvard’s endowment which will allow for the admittance of an even greater number of tools. As we’ve learned from month to month, though, no matter the size of the endowment, it’s useless if the tunnel’s flooded. We’re not expecting traffic to be as bad as it seems, though, as most Cambridge commuters agree that it’s better to ride one red line than two blue lines. Watch as the band forms a sigh of relief and plays “Rescue Me.”

Motions have been made recently to make Harvard’s curriculum more like Brown’s, but with a few crucial differences. For instance, a Harvard education now comes with 33% more self-importance—FREE! As each grading period approaches, students might feel that their theories retain more water, and find their GPAs to be generally bloated. However, studies have shown that once these grading periods are over forever, the student body begins to droop in places it never did before. The band will pause to form the variable that keeps students productive and give you your curriculum Any Way You Want It.

We view Harvard’s curriculum change as a new provocation in the age-old color war between Brown the University and Crimson the Abstract Mascot. Looking to settle this dispute, the never-discreet band will ambush any Harvard students trickling down to Providence and stop them from creating a mess. In the final confrontation of this dispute, we’ll tamp down our ammo and drive them back to Cambridge, where they’ll be doomed to wander the Square as a pack of traveling minstrels. The band will march to victory to the tune of “Brown Man Born” as we stop the Crimson surge!

As the band gently removes itself from the field, we’re reminded of next week’s trip to exotic Kingston, RI, where the Bears will face the Rams and the band will surely Exeter, even though it hardly knows ‘er.
