## Pregame

::script-note[Homecoming was nearly rained out. We marched straight across for pre-game on Ever True.]

## Halftime

We formed Sputnik rocket and shot a missile off which came back with the homecoming queen. Then on a single chorus of Victory March marched out to the 2 forty yard lines and about face while playing and reformed an arrow facing the queenâ€™s car.
