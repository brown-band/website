## Pregame

Usual entrance between stands on Ever True 2 choruses. Stop in front of Yale in Block and play Bulldog. Roll-off into BBB standing thru the intro — then automatically turn and cut for the 30-40-50-etc. and down on the new formation to our stands. Brown Man Born and then off.

## Halftime

March on from Brown’s left and down the field on BBB break band into 2 blocks (squares) each 45 to 30 dice brought on and the Yale and Brown man have a dice game. The blocks (Dice) revolve as the music of Yale and Brown respectively is played. Block to the Block on Ever True and Alma Mater and off.
