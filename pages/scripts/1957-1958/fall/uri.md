## Halftime

We presented several things. First we were sprayed by an Asiatic flu carrier and played “I’ve got you under my skin” Second we formed a hypo needle and played “I get a kick out of you” as needle exploded. Next into a droodle of flu germ who has caught penicillin being spurned by his friends. From there we ran into GIVE for for United Fund and combined with Boy Scouts. Scouts didn’t rehearse but we went on anyway.
