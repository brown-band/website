Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni! Presenting an organization that thinks fall 2003 was a fantastic time to be alive, it’s the Brown University "There’s Nothing Wrong with Reusing and Recycling" BAAANNNNDDDDD!

The great rivalries of our time: Cubs and White Sox. Don Zimmer and Pedro Martinez. Harvard and Yale. Everyone and Harvard. And now, Brown and Columbia. A Columbia student recently proposed that his school and ours, both without recognized rivals, come together and agree to, well, not come together. So, in true rivalry spirit, we’d like to start things off by saying... Columbia smells like Jersey.

:sd[Band forms Dollar Sign and plays "I Touch Myself."]

Sorry to build you up and let your down, Columbia, but we don’t think it will work out. Brown has too many rivals already: The MIFT, SUNY Globalization, Colonialism Community College, Brandeis... We’re spread thinner than a chickenhawk’s army after a unilateral strike. So let’s just be friends. As a token of our good will, the band will go back a few minutes and pretend the first paragraph never happened.

\*\*phone ringing noises\*\* "Hello? ... Oh, hi Mrs. C" Columbia, it’s your mom. "Yeah, I can take a message. What? ... I can’t say that. ... Mrs. C you shouldn’t say that about. ... Mrs. C, I think you’re trying to seduce me. ... Alright, alright. Thanks for the brownies, by the way. ... Okay, bye Mrs. C" Hey Columbia, your mom called, and she said ... "you do not meet her expectations for performance or effectiveness."
