Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just hibernated for six weeks, it’s the Brown University “We literally ARE Brown Bears” BAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDD!

Welcome back, one and all,. We’re sure you all missed us dearly while we were away, soaking up some sun. What else happened during the millennia we were away? Well, for starters, the roof of the Pitz—formally called the Pitzitola Sports Center Membrane Roof—collapsed in exactly the same fashion as the Metrodome. Then, because we were away for so long, global warming ended and the ice age restarted in a scenario not unlike The Day After Tomorrow. And just when we thought things couldn’t get more exciting, our men’s hockey team fulfilled a prophecy cast by a certain soccer player and literally “Beat the Yales 3-2.” What a productive break Brown had!

While Brunonians were enjoying six blissful weeks of snow and slumber, our unlucky opponents, the Dartmouth Green Bay Packers, had to brave the frozen wasteland as they headed back to school for their winter trimester. Why would anyone want to go back to Dartmouth before April when the campus has finally melted and the polar bears living there have migrated back to the North Pole? Eight words, folks: The 100th Anniversary of the Dartmouth Winter KarnEvil. I know, right? Who WOULDN’T want to participate in fun activities such as the polar bear swim, snowshoe races, and cross-country-skiing-race-battle-Royale-Ninja-Warrior-challenge? What’s next, Dartmouth? Forcing your students to (drunkenly) act out scenes from popular video games, snow Goombas and all? That’s sick, Big Green. That’s just sick.

Oh, right, stuff happened in the Real World while we were on break, too. The only newsworthy thing we could remember is fact that Bill Clinton will not be in The Hangover II. Such a disappointment! And now, a list of famous Dartmouth alumni who will also not be in The Hangover II: Meryl Streep.

Phew, first ice show of the year completed! One down, one to go! Tune in on February 25 as our Men’s Hockey team takes on Cornell ‘s Big Red Carpet in celebration of the Academy Awards Ceremony taking place that weekend. Give our regards to Broadway, or should we say Hollywood?
