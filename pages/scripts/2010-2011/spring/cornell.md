Jeff: Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants to train YOUR dragon, it’s the Brown University “And the Oscar goes to…” BAAAANNNNNDDDDDDD!

Jeff: Welcome, one and all, to the Eighty-Third Annual Academy Awards Ceremony. As you can see, the Band is all decked out in their most resplendent attire as they walk (or skate) all over the BIG RED CARPET. Other: Why yes, Jeff, and don’t they look nice! And sorry for getting to the booth a bit late. Who’s already gotten to the ceremony? Jeff: Well, you missed Geoffrey Rush arriving in a giant egg, and apparently there was some sort of showdown between Jeff Bridges’ three multiple personalities-the Dude versus Clu versus Rooster Cogburn! Other: Woah, wish I could’ve seen that! But-wait, is that James Franco? Why is he missing one of his legs? Jeff: I… couldn’t tell you, to be honest. Oh, by the way, Colin Firth was quoted in an earlier interview as saying “I’m a thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles because I’m a thistle sifter.” Other: That’s deep, man, that’s deep. Roll Tide!
