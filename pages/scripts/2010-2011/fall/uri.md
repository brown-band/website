## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves Mr. Rogers and his sweaters more than life itself, it’s the Brown University “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” BAAAAAAAAAND!

Hello mon, we’re glad to be here in Kingston, Jamaica, again. Taking a trip to the Neighborhood of Make-Believe is always so much fun! With your cool innovations like the QuadCam live campus video and your mob connections, there’s no place we’d rather be! But as good a neighbor as you are, we’d rather not visit more than once a year for the Governor’s Cup. Watch now as the band celebrates our visit to Providence Plantations!

Mr. Rogers isn’t the only one who knows about neighbors! Elizabeth Barrett Browning says, “A good neighbor sometimes cuts your morning up to mince-meat of the very smallest talk, then helps to sugar her bohea at night with your reputation.” Murray Kempton wisely states, “A neighborhood is where, when you go out of it, you get beat up.” Watch now as the band loves our neighbor!

Finally, we’ll just remind everyone at URI just what a loving relationship our two schools have. We’re the Griffins to your Quagmire, your Simpsons to your Flanders, the South Korea to your North Korea and though we’re the Germany to your Russia, at least we don’t invade you every winter. Or do we? Watch now as the band exalts in our supremacy!

Thanks for watching, folks, and be sure to join us in two weeks as we take on Princeton. Grade inflator? I hardly know her!
