## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that appreciates the alumni of Cornell, it’s the Brown University “Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill Nye the Science Guy!” BAND!

Because Cornell is a roughly 98.3% state and 1.7% private school, there are some disparities in the quality of education between our two universities. For example, here are some things one can learn at Cornell:

- How can a clam cram in a clean cream can?
- Picky people pick Peter Pan Peanut-Butter, ’tis the peanut-butter picky people pick.
- The big black bug bit the big black bear, but the big black bear bit the big black bug back!\
  And everybody’s favorite...
- Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers!

PHEW!

That’s right, folks, Cornell students sit around saying tongue-twisters all day! At Brown, we like to prove how intelligent we are in a different manner.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that was not eaten by its parents, it’s the Brown University “Thank G-d We’re Not Hamsters!” BAAAANNNNDDDDD!

It’s that time of year again, the beloved Parents’ Weekend! Let us just warn you, though, a few things have changed since you saw us last. We’re sorry to disappoint, because we know how badly you want us to get jobs and become real adults, but we’re majoring in unemployment and alcoholism. Also, we’ve decided to stop calling you “mom and dad” because here at Brown, we believe that true parenting is a spectrum. Far be it from us to fall into the cultural hegemony of parenting! But, wait... who’s the hottie with the body sitting in the stands over there? That’s right, I’m looking at you, Stacy’s Mom... Dad... parental figure... oh, whatever...

:sd[Band forms “HI MOM” and plays “Stacy’s Mom.”]

Look out, band, it’s everyone’s worst nightmare who’s come to visit for the weekend... the Jewish Mother! :sd[in a Jewish mother voice] ELROD SNIDLEY, YOU GET YOUR LITTLE TUCCHUS OVER HERE RIGHT NOW. I’ve just been to your room, and the place is filthy! Oy vey, the things I have to do to take care of my son. By the way, I’ve been down to the new Stephen Robert Campus Center, you know, the one in Faunce Arch? That building is beeeeeeauuuutiful! I bet you’ll find some nice Shaynas studying there! Just don’t put milk and cheese on the foccacia sandwhiches... Keep it kosher! :sd[in regular announcer voice] Come on, Eileen—I mean Mrs. Goldsteinowitz—leave us alone already!

:sd[Band forms Guilty Face plays “Come On Eileen.”]

Thank goodness we got rid of her! All that guilt gets difficult to deal with. You know what else is difficult to deal with? The pressure of being a second-rate university. Where were we? Oh, yes. Cornell, did you know that you are living a lie? Contrary to Frederick Rudolph’s view, you’re not the “First American University;” you’re not even the first Cornell! Cornell College, located in Iowa, was founded four years before Cornell University. They only take one class at a time, that still manages to be more rigorous than the one up in Ithaca! That’s what you get for living on a farm. Watch now, parents, as your children celebrate Brown’s utter pwnage of Cornell.

:sd[Band forms a top tenth percentile average at Cornell and plays Brown Bear.]

Parents, it’s been lovely having you here! Be sure to check back next week as we head down to the City of Brotherly Love to take on the meatheads at UPenn! Quaker? I hardly know ‘er!
