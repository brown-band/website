Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has a restraining order against it that keeps it from approaching Harvard's obnoxiously large drum, it's the Brown University "So Good We're Illegal" BAND!

Well, looks it's that time of the month again, folks<smdash/>the Harvard game! We heard that Harvard had to put a dome onto its stadium to stop the crimson flow... hopefully we won't have to do that here! We've got enough to worry about, what with our endowment shrinkage. You know what they say, though<smdash/>it's not the size of your endowment; it's how you use it! Right, Harvard? Because, let's be honest, folks, Harvard is the AIG of the Ivy League: "too big to fail." Watch as the band celebrates the fact that WE won't need a bailout.

Harvard's really been making a name for itself in rankings recently: it lost its position of "top university in the world" to Cambridge, lost the "Top School for Brainiacs" to Yale, was conspicuously missing from the "Top 25 Most Diverse Schools" and the "Top 25 Schools for Do-Gooders," and, most shockingly, is the #4 Anti-Party School in the United States. That's right, Harvard out-ranked MIT, Bringham Young University and even *#8* West Point. We all know about "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," but Harvard's "You Talk, You Die" anti-party stance seems a little harsh. Watch now as the Band looks back on the good times we have.

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's just as astonished that this game is taking place at nighttime as you are, the Brown University "We Look Better in the Dark" BAND!
</sp>
<sp>
We all know that this is Brown University's first ever NIGHT GAME, but did you ever wonder why we haven't played during the midnight hours before this very evening? Well, the Band suggests that we use the field for other things once the sun sets, like hosting SexPowerGod or providing a campground for the refugees of Hurricane Earl. What's more, the Band would like to hold the always-special "Grass Fire," an on-land counterpoint to "Water Fire" every Saturday. It's for our glaucoma, we swear!

Another problem with night games in the past was the lighting situation. Unfortunately, Thomas Edison wasn't a Brown Alumnus, and had we installed lights previous to this game, they would have to have been CFL's, which don't shine nearly bright enough. Next year, we encourage the Athletics Department to get creative with its lighting solutions: football players can wear glow-in-the-dark pants, have a Free Infrared Goggle giveaway, or have DPS place Blue Light Phones around the field, which will help if our players get tackled, too. But we're lucky to have some lights now on this special occasion.

Harvard has lights though, because they have money. Fun fact: all graduates of the Harvard Business School have to take an Ethics Pledge upon graduation. Odd, considering no one at Harvard knows what "ethics" means. We wonder what that pledge sounds like... "I, state your name, do solemnly swear not to do the following:

Thanks for coming by for this historic game, everyone! Be sure to come on down to Kingston to see two football teams and one cup!
