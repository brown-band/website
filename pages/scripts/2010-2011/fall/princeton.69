Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that doesn't restrict where its members can scrounge up a meal, it's the Brown University "Please Sir, Can I Have Some More?" BAANNNNNNDDDD!

Sorry, we know that dining club jokes aren't terribly original. But, when your school has something like a Dining Club Taskforce, you're asking for it! We know that you're the "Hungry Hungry Tigers" of the Ivy League, but do you have dining clubs that accommodate the richly diverse student body of your fine university? Oh, wait... what diversity? Watch as the band celebrates Brown's freedom of dinner choice and diversity!

<sd>Band forms Number Muncher and plays "Any Way You Want It."</sd>

Unfortunately, while our students do have more dining opportunities, we have to pay an arm and a leg to attend the University. Not all of us have Mommy and Daddy's loving support (and trust funds) at our full command! We know that not all Princeton students do either, which is why they should go searching for some tigers FAST! Did you know that 10 tiger phalluses<smdash/>used in rare Eastern healing techniques<smdash/>can pay for one year at Princeton? Time to get hunting! Watch as the band is relieved that its university's mascot isn't such a hot commodity.

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just recently got out of a messy divorce, it's the Brown University "Single and Ready to Mingle" BAANNNNNDDDDD!

Hello and welcome to the dating game, where our three mystery contestants will try to win the hearts of the band members. Contestant Number One, describe your dream date for the band. <sd>In a guido voice:</sd> "Well, after gettin' MY NEW HAIRCUT, I tink that we won't even have ta go on a date. But, in case we do have to do somethin', I guess we can hit up the gym and the band can watch me get my sweat on before DOIN' SOME SERIOUS JAGERBOMBS!" <sd>In regular announcer voice:</sd> Well, thanks but no thanks, contestant number one. Or should I say PRINCETON? The Brown Band has more "thrilling" things to do on Saturday nights!
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms a Jagerbomb and plays "Thriller."</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Now, Contestant Number Two, the Brown Band is rather politically-minded, so some political intelligence would be nice. What do you think about the current state of affairs in the United States? <sd>Just make dumb sounds:</sd> "Uhh, *blow a raspberry* aksdfjlakjfalkdjfalkdjfaldfjld." <sd>In regular announcer voice:</sd> Get outta here, PENN! Nobody likes you and the band will never date you, not if we were the last two people on earth! Watch as the band gets its groove on without contestant number two!
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms the average Penn GPA (D+) and plays "Vehicle."</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
And, finally, contestant number three, it's all down to you. Why should we pick you? <sd>In voice that exudes awesomeness:</sd>
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A) Elrod Snidley. </sli>
<sli>B) Ruth Simmons. </sli>
<sli>C) We ranked higher than Princeton in the Trojan Sexual Health report. </sli>
<sli>D) We bang AND blow! </sli>
<sli>E) Motorcyclists on Thayer beat guidos any day of the week. </sli>
<sli>F) THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms a B and plays "Brown Man Born."</sd>
</sp>

Looks like contestant three, BROWN, has won the dating game! As if there were ever any doubt... Join us next week as we take on Cornell at home. Ithaca may be "gorges," but we prefer the safety of Providence!
