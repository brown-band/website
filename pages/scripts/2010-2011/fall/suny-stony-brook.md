## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that spent its entire summer building a one-hundred foot tall Command Center while Faunce was renovated, it's the Brown University "Jonas Brothers Award for Best Band in Providence County" BAAAAAND!

The band was extremely unhappy to find that besides creating a new website and a new School of Engineering, its university had spent the summer replacing all of the drinking fountains around campus with "hydration stations." How are those of us without eco-friendly metal water bottles supposed to get our recommended eight glasses of water per day now? Oh, wait, we can't drink water anyway because today happens to be Yom Kippur! Instead, have some Manischewitz, but only after the sun goes down! Watch as the Band celebrates this joyous Day of Atonement.

But, aside from working these new improvements into our lives, there are some great things to do at Brown: join an a capella group, visit the frats on the weekend, sneak into FishCo with a fake, discover Wickenden Street after being a student here for four years... the list goes on and on. It's the same situation over at Stonybrook, which was voted the Number 1 school in the "Things to do on the Weekend" category. Some examples of weekend activities: viewing the hilarious Dog Comedy Show at the Long Island Game Farm Zoo, furiously polluting onself, doing Jager Bombs in the Wang Center, and, if things get desperate, furiously taking matters into one's own hands. What a broad list of extracurriculars!

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has better things to do with its time on weekends, it's the Brown University "Bears Eat Seawolves for Breakfast" BAAAAAND!

Now that the summer flicks are finally out of theaters, it's time for the real Oscar-nominee material to start hitting the silver screen. One film that looks especially avant-garde is "Dances with Seawolves," an uplifting tale of a young man thrown into the sea because he was too nouveau riche for West Egg. He befriends a colony of seawolves underwater, and with the help of his new amphibious mammalian friends, learns that while money can't buy you happiness, a good strand of seaweed and some top-notch pirouettes can. But what will our protagonist do when the Long Island Game Farm Zoo wants to take his newfound family into custody?

While not quite Oscar material, this next film will certainly be a hit with thirteen-year-olds and cougar housewivesâ€”"Twilight: Seaclipse." What will happen when totally average manatee Bella is forced to choose between brooding, sparkly Vampire-Shark Edward and muscular, but rather-more-ordinary Sea Werewolf Jacob? Worlds will collide as the University of Alaska Seawolf colony tries to recruit Jacob to the dark side and Edward starts to realize that sharks use manatees for food, not gratuitous snogging. How will Bella come to grips with the fact that seawolves are actually not wolves with tails, but instead strange eel-fish hybrids?

The last exciting fall movie, opening only on Long Island as a special promotion, is "Seawolfman." Antonio Banderas renders a heartbreaking performance as a man who, on every full moon, turns into a bloodthirsty seawolf who's just looking for some love, and also some tasty victims. When his old rival, Bruno the Bearman, shows his intelligent and sexy face in town, will there be any hope for Seawolfman's love life? Or will he be too busy terrorizing the residents of Suffolk County at every full moon to realize that Bruno has stolen his lady love from right under his nose? Watch now as the Brown Band celebrates Seawolfman's defeat at Bruno's hands.

Sadly, that's all the previews we have for now. Join us next week as Brown takes on Harvard for Homecoming... we look a lot better in the dark!
