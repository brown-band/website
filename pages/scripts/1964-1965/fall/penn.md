This afternoon the Band will present a salute to the candidates, as it marches from right to left across the field,

:sd[Band marches to glasses]

The Bend salutes the Immigrant peddlers grandson … from the extreme right of the field … as it plays <u>Beautiful Dreamer</u>. Incidentally, the glasses you see on the field have no Lenses.

The Band now salutes the Democratic candidate from the radical middle of the field. The formation that has been made is a lonely desk, in a big room, in a little white house, behind a big iron fence, far from ’Ole Texas.

:sd[Band marches to Massa-york.]

In salute to the Keating - Kennedy race in New York, the Band has formed the states of New York and Massachusetts. As an aid to Mr. Kennedy's ambitions, the Band suggests the formation of a new state: Massa-york.

:sd[Band removes dividing line.]

This would definitely be Bobby’s home state.\
