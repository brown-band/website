The Band has formed an E, in salute to the traditional Pembroke custom of Father-Daughter Weekend, The E on the field is in memory of Sophocle’s Greek heroine, Electra.

The Band has formed an E as a salute to mid-semester exams.. In an attempt to avoid this fate, the members of the Band, instead of playing a song will now study for 15 seconds.

:sd[March around to E]

Guess what the Band has formed this time—as it salutes Brown’s Sharpe Refectory. The E could stand for eat, but in this case it stands for <u>EUCCH</u>! As a substitute, the Band endorses the formation of a Brown Eating Club, but with a special type of waitress. The Band plays the “Bunny Hop”.

Finally the Band salutes the United Fund by forming the next to the last letter in the word United. In recognition of the United Fund’s service to the R.I. community, the Band presents a statement specially prepared for today’s show: Quote: “The 1964 United Fund campaign to serve human needs is under way. Every year the Brown University Band salutes the United Fund campaign. Today the Band urges all, no matter where they live, to support their United Fund or Community Chests,” Unquote, The Band wishes success to the campaign as it plays ‘Pennies from Heaven’.

The Band concludes by forming a Concert E. We salute the festivities of Pembroke Father-Daughter Weekend by playing, in concert, E. E. Bagley’s famous march, the “Purple Carnival”.
