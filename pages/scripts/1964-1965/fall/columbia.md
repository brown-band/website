After witnessing devastating attacks by the backs of opposing football teams, the Brown Bandhas discovered—through extensive recruiting efforts—an athlete who will undoubtedly become the Brown back of the century—Better than Columbia's one-man team—able to leap tall lineman at a single bound: “Cosmo Iaca-Horsey”!!

This fall the band has watched and commented as the Rockefeller Library neared completion. With the “Rock” having been dedicated last week, many people have wondered what’s to be done with the “Hay”. To the band and its horse the solution is obvious. The band plays “HAY—Look me Over”.

This season the band has often saluted Pembroke College. In so doing we have inadverdently slighted the young ladies of Providence, who we now salute by forming the intersection of Thayer and George—as we play "Standing on the Corner",

:sd[Band forms an E]

Although realizing the dangers of this contraversial formation, the band has formed—an E, as its final formation of the year, standing for <u>end</u>. We hope that you will all come out to Brown Stadium to see the band again next year. The football team will also appear.
