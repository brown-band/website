In honor of the 400<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of William Shakespeare’s birth, the Brown Band presents scenes from his plays, together with the songs he might have used if he had been writing for the <del>Yale</del> <small>(Dartmouth)</small> Community. The Band has formed a 400 year old birthday cake.

“Is this a dagger I see before me, the handle toward my hand?” For the benefit of those who have not yet taken Professor Charles Prouty’s Shakespeare course, the Band will answer this question and salute the actor who posed it, with its next song.

On a barge, like the one the Band has formed on the field, Antony and Cleopatra cruised down the Nile; with them is Yale Professor of Law Fowler V. Harper, battling for individual freedom. The Band plays: <u>Getting to Know You</u>.

The Band has now formed a spot. We suggest a solution to Lady MacBeth’s problem when she said “Out, out damned spot”
