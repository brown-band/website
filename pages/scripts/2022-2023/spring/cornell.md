Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that thinks there is entirely too much water in here, it’s the Brown University “high above cheep cheep beach” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Sweet Arceus! We’ve just noticed that you seem to be using a BEAR as a mascot! As Brown University of America, we are compelled to actively enforce our trademark rights or risk losing our very own bear. We would appreciate if you could cease and desist from using your “bear” mascot in future public displays. As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to offer a few new, non-infringing mascots for your consideration:

:::script-list

- A. A sad, lonely engineer with no friends
- B. A cheese hotel bellhop :sd[band: ROOM SERVICE!]
- C. Your finest invention, the chicken nugget
- D. An ear of corn with no other possible interpretations
- E. A completely original Italian man with a black mustache, a red hat, and overalls, and
- F. The Princeton band

::::

Maybe you’d be better off sticking with the Big Red What. Watch now as the band mutinies against the czar and plays the Battleship Potemkin Theme.

Welcome to our Nintendo-themed ice show! Who’s your favorite character? Ours is Mario, otherwise known as the third president of Cuba, otherwise known as a member of the Cornell class of 1888. After his graduation, he hopped on board the King of Red Lions and sailed for home. Little did he know, his voyage from Ithaca had been cursed by the Greek gods. In the words of another Cornell alumnus, get your bodies ready and watch now as the Band embarks on a journey across the Great Sea and plays, “My Rule or the Hyrule.”

Indomitable, I choose you! We know that Cornellians are united by a shared purpose: :sd[Evil voice] To protect the world from devasta–:sd[Normal voice] I mean, uh, to be the very best, like no one ever was. Unfortunately, you’re still only the second-best Ivy in New York, but keep going! You’ll get there eventually! Violating anti-trust laws related to admissions and financial aid isn’t the way to do it though, so maybe try to keep that to a minimum. Also, type diversity on a team is important; you can’t just release four live bear cubs onto the field and call it a day. Now shhh…the Cuccos are taking their prelims… and watch now as the Band engages in an immensely complex and high-risk maneuver while playing “Now You’re Fraying With Power”!

:sd[Band counterskates into a B while playing “In The Fray.”]

Catch us before we catch you! Brown Band Out.
