Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that feels the passing years slowly weighing us down, it’s the Brown University “get off my rink!” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Welcome to Providence, Clarkson! Today, we have invited one of our most experienced faculty members to meet one of your most mature students — Josiah Carberry, meet Joe Bushey! Joe’s Clarkson experience has been a rather bizarre adventure, having entered the school in 1961 and _almost_ graduated in 1973. At this rate, he may die before he gets his degree — but I’m sure that Clarkson students, in the words of two notable alumni, don’t fear the reaper. They already feel the icy chill of death every day! (Or is that just Potsdam’s frigid climate?) Watch now as the band forms a perfectly normal maple leaf and plays “Shipping Up to Canada.” :sd[band: GO POTsdam]

Reinvigorated by our breath of fresh air, we stumble back onto campus. Classes start tomorrow, but we don’t know our purpose yet so how are we supposed to achieve it here at Clarkson? WIth the registration deadline nearing, we frantically read through the list of available majors. A few jump out at us:

:::script-list

- A. Conservative Arts, _interdisciplinary_
- B. Effective Prevention of Pump-Induced Trauma
- C. Global supply chain management (have you Ever Given this major a thought?)
- D. Personal industrial hygiene (gotta keep the equipment clean)
- E. Maple syrup appreciation, and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the Band chooses the right major for us, sees a falling pump, and plays “Stop, Rock, and Roll.”

After that brush with mortality, our Clarkson alter egos have found their single-minded focus: hockey. Hockey. HOCKEY. Clarkson students are practically hockey zombies, as opposed to Brown students, who only become zombies after they graduate. Don’t worry, though; I’m sure the bite wound on the alum next to you is perfectly safe. Open sores would just get in the way of the mission of sliding a little black disk on frozen water. The only thing better than hockeying is hockeying while also hockeying. Watch now as the band twirls our preeeecious :sd[said like Gollum] sticks and energetically shrieks in unison while playing “4 Bruno and 4 Braaaiins.”

Catch us before we catch you! Brown Band Out.
