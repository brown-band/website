Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has definitely not been kidnapped and replaced by aliens, it’s the Brown University “I am a normal human being speaking with my normal human vocal cords” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Ah, spring is here! It’s so beautiful to see the trees blooming and the sun shining on your—oops, our—beautiful world. Spring smells so good here. This magical green mist hanging upon the green grass of the main green makes our human olfactory receptors feel a way that they have never felt before. Toooooootally quintesseeeeeential, man! Observing the way humans consume this delectable vegetable brings me suck pleasure. :sd[whispered] Um, are you sure the translator’s working right? :sd[normal] Uh, nothing to hear there! Pipe down, get your rod up, and watch now as the band plays “Cock Monster.”

:sd[Band forms a weed bowl and plays “Rock Lobster.”]

My name’s 2001 Honda Civic, and I’m looking for your headmaster. I hear her name is Mary Jane Paxson—could you direct me where to find her? It will only take five of your—er, our earth minutes. Nooooo! I don’t want to kidnap her or anything, just to give her a friendly greeting. Here are some of the most pressing questions we have for her:

:::script-list

- A. From whence did you originate?
- B. Wheretofore shall you go?
- C. Who is the mysterious Cottonmouth Joe?
- D. As ye sow, so shall ye reap???
- E. GIVE ME ALL YOUR TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL, and
- F. The Princeton band?

As real Brown students, we are proud to continue Brown’s tradition of cutting-edge anthropological research, and we’re currently wondering—what’s in all those vases? Inhale from this oblong glassware, prepare to be probed (if you’re comfortable with that), and watch now as the band plays “Long Schlong Song.”

:sd[Band forms a bong and plays “Ding Dong Song.”]

The time has come and resistance is futile. We breathe in deeply. Our eyes are becoming red, our stomachs are a-rumble, and our contamination badges are beeping, but we don’t care! The only three letters we love more than UFO are THC, and we can’t get enough. ET, please light up. Watch now as the band—oh, who gives a shit, hu-man? Watch now as the band arms our lasers and plays “WEED THEME.”

:sd[Band forms a UFO and plays “Wii Theme.”]

Roswell that ends well. Brown Band Out.
