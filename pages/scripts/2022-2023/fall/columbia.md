## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization with plenty of opinions about where to store your bagels, it’s the Brown University, “penny for OUR thoughts?” BAAAAAAANNNND!

Listen, folks, thinking about the future is stressful. Whether it’s the paper due at 12:00pm tonight or our job application to the Bogota Museum of Psychoceramics, sometimes things get a little overwhelming. How do we cope, you might ask? Bagel yoga! It’s like goat yoga, but with bagels. Do you want to try? There, balance it on your nose. Next, ….oh! Genius! Never thought you could put a bagel there. I feel the stress leaving me already. Time to put on some peaceful, quiet music to lull me off to sleep… hey band, think you could help me out with a lullaby?

:sd[Band forms an airplane and plays “Ding Dong Song,” starting at the really loud part.]

Wow, that was exactly what I needed! Catch us at halftime when we honor the class of 2023 with the performance of a masterpiece that is both sentimental and transcendental.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is aging more rapidly than anyone could have imagined, it’s the Brown University “did you know we went to Brown before COVID started?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

While we’ve enjoyed torturing our seniors over the past four years, it’s nothing compared to what your ever-so-helpful math professor did! Bumping y’all down to 18th? Yikes… But who cares about rankings anyway? It’s what's in the heart that matters, and we looooove our seniors. Let’s give a toast to verse–What could possibly go worse? Expressing love for seniors in rhyme, until we run all out of . . . remaining seconds in the show? Dang it, what rhymes with that, anyway? While I think, watch now as our champagne flute bubbles with enthusiasm for the class of 2023!

:sd[underclassmen form a champagne glass; seniors run into the glass as their line is read; band plays bits and pieces of “Ever True”]

A flautist in heart but not song\
Her melodica part is so strong\
She dealt with buttons so fierce\
Our jackets they pierce\
Abby, please don’t leave us for long!

Our prez, Adeline, number-one bear\
Who plays clarinet with such flair\
She could run to Montana\
While she holds up the band-a\
And shows unconditional care.

Our Seattle mademoiselle\
Her baton twirling truly is swell\
She conducts us with vigor\
Her heart just grows bigger,\
Beatrice’s love for band cannot be quelled

From glorious NoVa you hail\
Playing beautiful flute without fail\
The best at email sending\
Choice of instrument pending\
Evertrue in our heart, Corrin prevail

On Dana I’d bet any money\
A member of music groups sundry\
Our leading conductor\
No one can obstruct her\
Standing proud in her tiger onesie

dear Emma, enthusiast of kpop\
Our Fearless leader of BOP\
Sings like a beaut\
And dazzles on flute\
She makes our days brighter nonstop

He knows fluid and music mechanics\
About bari-saxes, he’s manic\
Democratic elections are new\
Cooks a mean Somali stew\
But mushrooms cause Haoyi to panic

His spirited snare sticks sustain us\
Jed’s dedication has never once failed us\
He’s bought us some iPhones\
Takes photos of cool stones\
Enjoy California, tech genius

There once was a man named Jude\
He was quite the musical dude\
He smacked on the snare\
And rolled off with flair\
Without him we’ll truly be screwed

There once was a Mom from New Hampshire\
Named Noah who was quick with good banter\
With a head bald like Caillou\
In barefoot shoes he’ll run by you\
For veganism he is quite the ranter\

And now for our new band recruit\
Who impresses with tunes on his flute\
He comes from Atlanta\
Enjoys a banana\
And time with Shawn’s always a hoot

On Susan’s head is a bandana\
With their trumpet they go bananas\
Famous for their get ups\
Loves Dunkin’ and Cups\
They’re an all Boston Americana

Our most versatile Victoria Rose\
Gets youngsters to swipe for her Jo’s\
With noble Atlas at her side\
Many laughs she’s supplied\
From her home on the old country roads.

:sd[band finishes playing #1]

And now that they’ve been introduced, let’s see what our seniors have planned for us today. A show with STAGE CUES? Inconceivable!!! Well, let’s give it a shot: ACTION!

:sd[whole band looks around as if new to the area, frolics. then, forms a circle and makes offerings to the sousaphone.]

The year was 2019. We arrived in Providence fresh-faced, naïve, and full of childlike innocence. \
Then we joined the band. Despite being told in no uncertain terms by our elders that the band is NOT a cult, the perpetual singing of “Ever True to Brown” made us begin to wonder…

Regardless, over the years, we have allowed ourselves to be continuously corrupted and have subsequently contaminated the next generation of bandies, meaning that it is our time to leave (via a glorious cannon that will shoot us out of Providence and, likely, into space).

:sd[seniors run one way as if being shot from a cannon, cartwheeling if possible, and the underclassmen all stand still in a cannon shape pointing towards the front of the field and wave at them]

Despite perpetually being a part of the Brown Band, most things at Brown have changed a lot in the last three years. Let us remind you of a past when we lived in Keeney doubles and had no gray hair, lest the hourglass of time wipe away these facts for all eternity

:::script-list

- A. Blueno was actually on campus and not just in our hearts
- B. The Blue Room used to be open until 9pm! And on weekends! And they took swipes after 4!
- C. Every year, the wealthiest and most powerful students attended a special networking dinner
- D. 100% of campus called it New Dorm. IT’S CALLED NEW DORM!
- E. There used to be a station at Jo’s where someone would kiss you on the lips, and
- F. The Princeton band

:::

But you can’t bring back the past, so into the cannon we go. Watch now as the Band makes a period-appropriate form and plays “Everytime we Remember.”

:sd[Band forms a heart and plays “Everytime we Touch.” Towards the end, percussion solos as the rest of the band does the Everytime we Touch dance.]

All right, this show has been entirely too normal. Time to turn to the classic band tradition of Neo-Dadaism/Mamaism! As always, please remember to keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all times, and do not feed the bandies. What are you talking about? I don’t have dada issues, I just study art history. Hi folks! Did you know that Brown’s opponents today are Columbia? :sd[band: where?] Columbia! :sd[band: oh!] What you are witnessing is the manifestation of the subconscious mind. The Band is now in a state of pure creativity, and anything is possible. We tried to get the Band to make a form but it seems they have reverted to their kindergarten days. Red light! :sd[pause] Green light!

:sd[Band freezes at “red light” and resumes moving at “green light”]

Ok, time to come back inside and finish the school year! I know you’re all tired….and burnt out…and hungry….and sleepy….and…and… Watch now as the Band tries its best.

:sd[Each Section plays Favorite Song and makes Favorite Form]

Wow, that was great! We should submit this as part of our consulting application portfolios. Brown Band Out.
