## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that hopes you’re ready for an electrifying experience, it’s the Brown University “high as a kite” BANNNDDDDDDDDD!

We’re excited to be first-year students attending the best university in Pennsylvania, UPenn State. While we understand that Ivy League prestige eliminates the need for livable dorms, we didn’t think they’d go so far as to leave clogged trash chutes for days on end. What will happen to the garbage in my room? In the words of Penn’s esteemed new president, “let the experiment be made!” Watch now as the Band makes its own experiment in housing and plays “Leasing out the Radian.”

:sd[Band forms a banana peel and plays “Hooked on a Feeling.”]

Maybe the dorms aren’t great. So what! There’s plenty more to do around the University of Pennsylvania, right? After some brief research, here are the least worst options

:::script-list

- A. Chat with Ben on the Bench, who is more interesting than any living Penn student
- B. Anger one arm of the student government sextopus and watch your hopes sliiiiiide away
- C. Use the presidential keys for their true purpose: a highly dangerous experiment involving lightning and a kite
- D. Visit the real best school in Philadelphia, Abbott Elementary
- E. Get arrested for a totally reasonable protest during a football game, and
- F. The Princeton band

Realizing that maybe there isn’t as much going on at UPenn as we originally thought, watch now as the band tries to climb a light pole while celebrating victory and/or defeat at the ball game, discovers that the poles have been lubed for our protection, and plays “It’s Waaay too Smooooooth!”

:[Band forms a kite and plays “Smooth.”]

After painfully lifting ourselves up off the pavement, we’re feeling a little dizzy… or is it imagination? There’s stars floating, rockets whizzing between my ears, massive pieces of machinery boring tunnels into my brain. And also dollar signs? Whose reality have I woken up in? I look at the nameplate on my desk … SKUM NOLE? Never heard of them before. Maybe I’m one of those 28 living billionaires Penn prides itself on having produced. Realizing that we’ve woken up in the body of :sd[shudder] a Penn alum, we try to make ourselves feel better by acquiring Twitter. Watch now as the Band fervently tries to take back its decisions and plays “Brown Man Re-Born? PLEASE?”

:sd[Band forms a B and plays “Brown Man Born.”]

Catch us at halftime when we remember to acknowledge that most solemn of holidays coming up this Monday.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has the world’s first and second largest crystal balls, it’s the Brown University “what do YOU see when you ponder my orb?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

In case you were too bogged down in midterms to notice the overpriced decorations in every capitalist institution for the past 2 months, welcome to Halloweekend! Have you picked out your costume yet? Remember, the best costumes involve the element of surprise, NO cultural appropriation, and the minimum amount of clothing necessary to evoke the essence of your desired profession. Bring out your collection of ancient tweezers, gain strange pleasure from grooming your chest hair into the shape of a non-trademarked superhero logo, and watch now as the band regrets its decision and plays “I plucked myself.”

:sd[Band forms a B and plays “I Touch Myself.”]

Hippity Hoppity Your Costume Ideas Are My Intellectual Property. Brown Band Out.
