Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is about to run around screaming, it’s the Brown University “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

I take my horse down the new town road, and I riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide till the horse breaks its legs on your sidewalk’s 250 year old potholes. Harvard is so dedicated to “historical preservation” and “maintaining tradition,” it never bothered to fix the dents in the sidewalk created by cannonballs waaaaay back in the Revolutionary war. Fitting, considering that the Harvard student government is about as stable as that of France in the late 1700s, a not-at-all-concerning fun fact about the university that has produced the most US presidents. Run for the barricades — duck! guillotine to your left! — and watch now as the Band keeps its head screwed on tight and plays “Do You Hear the People Sing!”

:sd[Band forms a chopping block and plays “Party in The USA.”]

We think history is super cool, too! Let’s glance back at times past… in the year 1638 your beloved, sweet, papá — oops, you want us to call him “founder” — suffered death at the hands of consumption, foreshadowing the consumerist attitudes of modern-day America. In the third century, he was erected again as a statue…or at least, someone was. In the meantime, here are a few other old traditions Harvard’s kept since the good old days:

:::script-list

- A. No filming on campus. That’s right, _The Social Network_ lied to you.
- B. Repeating the same “fun facts” on every tour
- C. Repeating the same “fun facts” on every tour
- D. Romantic expressions of love (or lust) in the Widener library stacks
- E. Their student government structure… oh wait, that one’s not true. And
- F. The Princeton band

Chow down on hardtack, die of dysentery, and watch now as the band plays “Time Warp” :sd[band: again?] to bring us back to the present.

It’s a beautiful autumn day. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping and the football is…round? Wait a second. This isn’t the football I know! Why are they using their feet instead of their hands? And now that I think about it, why aren’t they wearing full protective suits, like the football players we usually smell on days like these? …hold on, this isn’t football! This is woooooomen’s soccer! We here in the Band love soccer! And feminism! And especially playing for a team that’s having a winning season! Overcome with love and affection for our soccer team, we can only say :sd[whole band cheers]. Hug your favorite player, sacrifice all your mortal possessions on an altar to the team, and watch now as the band appreciates its athletes and plays Brown Bears Win!

Soccer? I ’ardly know ‘er! Brown Band Out.
