Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization of cuddly bunnies, it’s the Brown University “what are you doing with that glockenspiel?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Since you’re the “cradle of bishops,” the Band would love to let you cradle _our_ bishops, but only if you’re willing to enter our sacred shrine grotto. We, too, revere and venerate our lady Lorde — “Royals” is the world’s best song, don’t @ me. We were under the impression that we would be banding at a football game today, but it seems like you have been breaking so many of the rules of football that I’m not sure if it’s even the same sport.

Ah! My schedule is telling me that this is instead something called “rug buy,” which sounds like a TV show my grandma would watch. It’s ok, grandma, they’re playing football. Let’s get you back to bed. Just sit back, relax, and watch now as the Band enters a spiritual formation and plays “Sweet Baby Jesus.”

Well-versed in the rules of rugby after a quick trip to our favorite search engine, we run out to join the team, clothed only in our mandatory mouthguards. Looking at your astonished and vaguely jealous expressions, we assume we might have gotten a few things wrong. Can you confirm or deny the following rugby facts? We just want to play by the rules here.

:::script-list

- A. Rugby must be played on a rug
- B. Your mauls don’t have food courts
- C. Instead of blocking, defending players may have an emotional breakdown
- D. You must only pass the ol’ pigskin backwards
- E. OH MY GOD IT’S A BEEEEEEEEEEEE and
- F. The Princeton band

We greatly a-B-ciate you helping us B the best rug-B players we can B. B-hold as the band B-comes a B and plays “Ev-B-Time B Touch”.

Live Significantly. Brown Band Out.
