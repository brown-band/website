## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that finally found the limit of scandals it’s willing to joke about, it’s the Brown University “hey, uhhh, are you okay in there?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Here in the Brown Band, we try to playfully jab at the controversies our opponents are embroiled in, but _oh my gosh_ Harvard, the only time you’re in the news is for something horrible. Like, we really don’t feel comfortable discussing any of it in this field show. What’s wrong with you??? I’m gonna have to take a break to process my feelings, so watch now as the band plays “Something’s Wrong Song.”

I couldn’t go on with the script I had planned. So instead, I’m going to give a tour of Harvard as it should be — unproblematic, fun, and downright jolly. If you have any questions, my name’s Elrod. Let’s start with the Annenberg dining hall. On Niche.com, our dining gets a grade of B+, but we all know that with the grade inflation on this campus, it’s really a D—which is a passing grade at Harvard, but not Brown. I guess they have higher academic standards in Providence, just like their campus elevation… and their students. Watch now as the band develops a sudden desire for snack foods and plays “Stoned on an Ottoman.”

:sd[Band forms a “D” and plays Hooked on a Feeling.]

We’re aware that at least half of you are tourists just here to see the campus. That’s fine! We’re more interesting than a DUKW boat tour, anyway! To those of you who _are_ applying: less than 4.20 % of you will actually get in, but that doesn’t mean this tour is totally pointless, right? RIGHT? If you do want to be accepted, you can rub the foot of John Harvard’s statue just across the way for some good luck—don’t worry! In the less-questionable version of Harvard, it’s totally safe to do that! Kiss some brass without worrying about personal hygiene and watch now as the band looks on knowingly, giggles, and plays “Statue Peeing Song.”

Oops, I’ve got to take daddy’s private jet to class… come back at halftime to hear the rest!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that doesn’t have a billion dollars to venmo you for admission to the Tasty Burger Basement, it’s the Brown University “I’d rather have my very first burger at Bartley’s” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Welcome back to the tour! Now that I’ve worn you down with miscellaneous trivia and you’re ready to accept this alternative Harvard reality as _veritas_ — uh, i mean, “truth,” here are the top six fun facts my bosses have told me I have to regurgitate!

:::script-list

- A. If you don’t get in, you can take Harvard’s free online classes in subjects like “Resilient Leadership”, “CS50 For Lawyers”, and “Omens, Oracles, and Prophecies.”
- B. Harvard’s living alumni include 188 billionaires—once I graduate, it’ll be 189.
- C. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright once praised our school for taking perfectly good plums as students and turning them into prunes.
- D. Every year, we form the world’s largest teacup by closing off Boston Harbor for an entire day and making tea in it!
- E. After you graduate, you can only refer to your undergrad education by saying “I went to school in Cambridge” followed by “…no, not MIT,” and
- F. The Princeton band

Wander from the Widener Library to the Skinnier Library, have a refreshing snack of tea and dried fruit, and remember that we are in fact not in Beantown as the band plays “Shipping Out of Boston”

Alright, the tour’s over—thanks for coming! For your party of 3, the total cost of your visit comes to $23 per person. Insert your credit card below and it’ll ask you one quick question. Most people answer at least 20%, but if you’re feeling generous, 69% is great too. Just make sure to save enough to have a shopping spree in Hahvahd Squayah. We love supporting the local community—that’s why we keep expanding into it!\
Watch now as the band thanks you for your tip, forms an H, and plays “For Cambridge is our Town.”
