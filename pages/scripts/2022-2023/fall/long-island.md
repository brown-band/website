Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization from an island better than Long, it’s the Brown University “we’re nor a rhode or an island” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

After last week’s mud fest, we’re glad to be back standing on drier, less-squishy ground. Even though we can now dry our clothes for free, we’re feeling more afraid of water than usual. We blame this fear on the sharks who now inhabit the field, as well as the fact that we watched all six Sharknado movies last night. Chainsaw your way out of the Shark Bite Residential Dining Hall with your lover and some Shark Bite Sushi and watch now as the band plays “Sharktown Girl.”

We know this is a long weekend, and thus most of you are aiming to avoid learning for the next seventy-two hours. Attendance in our Friday afternoon seminar on the history of Long Island was abnormally low, though, so allow me to fill you in on the details—you can thank me later!

:::script-list

- A. The bedrock under your campus is entirely unconsolidated glacial till.
- B. It is the only island in the world to completely lack man-made lighting at night.
- C. The furthest part of Long Island is only 69 miles from NYC, which is not far enough.
- D. It is the home of America’s first suburb (and we all know how that story ends).
- E. The name “Long Island” refers to its length, which is more important than size.
- F. The Princeton band

Sorry, I Great Gats-peed my pants during that part of the lecture and left early, so you’re on your own from here. Watch now as the band awaits the next glaciation and plays “Pretty Fluvial (For A Terminal Moraine).”

Although this field show will soon be gone, its legacy will live on forever. Brown Band Out.
