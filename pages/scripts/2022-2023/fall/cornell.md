## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s no longer shackled by the tyranny of censorship, it’s the Brown University “time for payback” BANNNDDDDDDDD!

Hellloooooooo Cornell! For the first time since 2018, you Big Red Whattocks have made the trek all the way to Providence—congratulations! You know what this means, right? It means that we’ve finally escaped the Ithaca Department of Evil Censors. No more frantic, late-night-script-rewriting sessions! Good riddance, emails that only say (quote) “your script is not approved.” Farewell to the days of wandering around on the field screaming, groaning, or in eerie, morose silence. Toot your own bugle, and watch now as the band exercises its right to free speech and plays Shut Up? No Chance!

:sd[Band forms a megaphone and plays “Shut Up and Dance.”]

WOW, that was so liberating! I haven’t felt that free since I started sleeping in the buff. Now that we’re no longer subject to your self-serving, confining, sticky, stuck-up rules, we’re so excited to make negative comments about…

:::script-list

- A. Cornell
- B. Its neighboring institutions
- C. The beautiful city of Ithaca
- D. Cornell Athletics
- E. Their request for our script to be approved, and
- F. The Princeton band

:::

Rip the duct tape off your mouth, tell Cornell to get lost in a Corn Maize, and watch now as the Band plays “Lips Don’t Lie”.

:sd[Band forms 🚫 and plays “Hips Don’t Lie.”]

Before you go, I wanted to retell a story my weird uncle Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! told me from his time at Cornell. Late one night, his supervisor at the Wilder Library asked if he was up for a more cerebral task than organizing by the Dewey Decimal System. He ended up carrying more than 500 poorly-preserved human brains, in buckets, out of the basement for disposal. Yup, that’s a true story—perhaps Cornell just shouldn’t be trusted with biological specimens! Watch now as the band confiscates the rest of their braaaaains and plays “For Refrigeration and For Maldehyde.”

:sd[Band forms a B and plays For Bruno and For Brown.]

We’re totally not zombies—or are we? Hang around until halftime to find out!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s grown in size in a tremendous and thoroughly expected manner, it’s the Brown University “yo mama’s so good at playing kazoo we sound like a symphony orchestra” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Welcome to our family weekend game—oh, have you met my dear aunt Sally? She’s _very_ proud of the arithmetic capabilities she gained from Brown’s Applied Math concentration, which she’s constantly reminding us that Cornell does NOT offer as an undergraduate major. Watch now as the band excuses her, forms an ordered sequence of operations and calculates how much Sally’s Mom has got it goin’ on.

:sd[Band forms “+ / -” and plays “Stacy’s Mom”.]

Feeling proud of our performance, we now introduce our parents to our friends. I’m so glad they’re able to tell you about the time I ate a half-eaten lollipop off the New York City subway floor when I was 4! And my parents seem so happy to hear that I got blackout drunk last Friday night that they’re tearing up! Oh wait, now Mom and Dad are lecturing me. Yep, uh-huh, I’ll be more careful in the future. I’ll go to health services and get a combination location/blood alcohol tracking device implanted on Monday. Noticing how you’re deflecting, the band forms a “B” for “But didn’t you always tell me stories about wild escapades at _your_ frat, dad?” and plays Brown Beer Drinking Song.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Brown Cheering Song.]

Catch us next week when we allow our wrath to descend upon Penn. Brown Band Out.
