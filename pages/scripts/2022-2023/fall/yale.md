## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s a little bit obnoxious and, yes, provocative, it’s the Brown University “I can wear whatever I want, mom!” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD! Trick or treat and watch now as the band forms our favorite candy and plays I’m a Halloweiner!

Catch us at halftime when we Go Directly To Yale (without passing GO or collecting $200).

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s renowned for its time-warping abilities, it’s the Brown University “again?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

To celebrate our first away game of the season, the Band is traveling not only in space but also in time! We’ve journeyed back to the good old days to attend Yale with Clarence, Samuel, Brett, and our bestie Sonia — did you know that Yale produced four ninths of the current Supreme Court? Shop Intro to Separation of Church and State, pick up your gavel from the bookstore, and watch now as the Band rigs the jury and plays Mock Lawyer.

:sd[Band forms a gavel and plays “Rock Lobster.”]

We’re still feeling a little dizzy from our journey, and our time machine didn’t tell us exactly what year we were delivered to. We decide to wander around New Haven and narrow it down based on the ages of various landmarks such as:

:::script-list

- A. Your shorter, stouter version of our SciLi (we tried to tip it over but couldn’t pour anything out)
- B. An underground courtyard, We tip over the poised cube and roll a 6!
- C. The Pirelli Tire Building, which is a 9 in my book
- D. The Kline Biology Tower, the world’s first nonorientable building
- E. The grave of Sarah Winchester, constructor of another nonorientable building, and
- F. The Princeton Band

:::

Our conclusion: The present is the past. Time is meaningless. Watch now as the band cleans our clocks and plays “I’m not a real time traveler but I am a real band”

:sd[Band forms a B and plays “Doctor Worm.”]

Suddenly finding ourselves in a frigid tundra, we search everywhere for refuge. We wander into a disused factory somewhere in Italy. The sign on the entrance reads “Eternit” with no Y. Too late, we realize that this is Stephan Schmidheiny’s old asbestos plant.\
Watch now as the Band changes course, moves its heiny out of the plant, coughs concerningly–don’t breathe in!–and plays Brown Asbestos Abatement Song.

::script-note[We actually played “I Touch Myself” due to a misprint of the form sheet. This is why you shouldn’t ask the Band to do asbestos abatement. — JF]

You just lost The Game​​. Brown Band Out.
