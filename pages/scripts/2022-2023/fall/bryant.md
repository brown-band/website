## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s ready for immense personal growth, it’s the Brown University “Release the bears, re-leash the bulldogs” BANNNDDDDDD!

As a Brown student, I can’t help but feel a little intimidated. You’ve left us stuck on your old campus while you get into move to a shiny new campus built by Mr. Tupperware himself! After last weekend’s flooding, we’d do anything to be living the suite life in suite village…well, almost anything. We wouldn’t want to suffer through the food offered at your dining halls, since being ranked #21 in "least tasty meal plans" isn’t the W you think it is, folks! Watch now as the Band soothes its burning, itching, wart-covered intestines, and plays "Everytime We Flush."

Bathroom break over, we unlock the stall door and stumble out of the CIA spaceship otherwise known as the Unistructure. It’s super cool that everything you need is in one place — mediocre generic food, endless identical classrooms, everyone you were rejected from Bentley with. Still feeling the burn and inspired to expel, we jump into the cool, refreshing pond — just like your president did 13 short years ago. Too late, we realize that your campus lagoon is a haven for an absurd number of migrating Canada Geese. Put on your Muck boots, buy a thousand-dollar winter coat, and watch now as the Band plays Goose Poop Forevermore.

Catch us at halftime when we cut deep into Bryant’s student culture!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that can’t wait to meet Tupper 3, it’s the Brown University :sd[scriptreader imitates a bulldog growl] BANNNDDDDDDDDD!

Happy national pasta week… is any linguini out there? Apparently not, considering that you’ve earned a whopping two out of five stars on [campuspastaindex.org](https://campuspastaindex.org). We suppose it’s true that Bryant is a “training ground for the businesspenne and -conchiglie of the future,” considering that your dining halls allow for precisely as many pasta shapes as you’ve had Tuppers — 2. Rest in peace, Tupper 1! I guess that’s what happens when you go to Bryant—where the only things that aren’t al dente are the walls of your many rotund buildings. Watch now as the Band demonstrates proper pasta etiquette by playing "Eat Like You’re in Pompeii."

Bryant, it’s been a while since you last joined us on College Hill, so here’s a brief refresher on our Open Curriculum. Here at Brown, we can take any class we want at any time we want —wait, no, that’s not true. We recently acknowledged the fundamental evils of capitalism and abolished our Business, Entrepreneurship, and Organizations concentration. On a related note, is it true that everyone at Bryant is required to get a business degree? Your dedication to business is soooo visible, just like your giant [sculpture](https://digitalcommons.bryant.edu/seniorclass_gifts/4/) inscribed with bartered items from 2200 BCE. Anyone want to trade 20 containers of fine beer for 5 sheep? We hear you have plenty of the former to go around. We’re also willing to throw in a couple hairballs from the special collection our library displayed all last year.

Procrastinate your job applications, get a letter of recommendation from your favorite relative, and watch now as the Band guarantees its grads a 99% job placement rate by hiring 98% of them itself and plays The Employment That I Get.
