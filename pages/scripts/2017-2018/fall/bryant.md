## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization whose old self can’t come to the phone right now it’s the Brown University “Why? Oh, because our landlines got disconnected” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

The Band is back and “bander” than ever. We are thrilled to be back on College Hill and would like to give a special welcome to all the first-years on campus. To those of you who ended up at the football stadium, are you lost? Did you take a wrong turn heading towards Smith-Buonanno Hall? Don’t worry, we understand how difficult it can be to adjust to college but YOU DON’T KNOW HOW GOOD YOU HAVE IT! You now have TWO renovated lounges in Morris and Emwool. Poké bowls in Andrews. And THREE types of water at the Ratty. What is the difference between “flat” and “cold” anyways? Watch now as the Band drinks from the fountain of youth (or is it just flat water?) and plays I Just Want Some Regular Water Please.

We have a serious problem here, Class of 2021. The vast majority of you were born in 1999. This means it is our last year before the 2000’s children descend upon our campus. Us 90’s kids need to stick together, including our beloved Josiah’s Café which was born in September 1991. Jo’s has been a fan favorite since its start. According to a Brown Daily Herald article, from the start Jo’s has been a “serious food organization” where one can get “good greasy meat”. According to Herald staff writer Micaela Schweitzer, it was the only place on campus one could find an “eight inches wide and four inches thick” grinder. Watch now as the Band forms something only 90s kids will remember and plays the Greasy Meat Cheering Song.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that spent too much money on avocado toast this summer, it’s the Brown University “Guess we’re not buying a house anytime soon” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

One of the other things we really enjoyed this summer was watching the solar eclipse. With protective glasses, of course. Not all of us have eyes of steel like POTUS. The last time a solar eclipse went from coast to coast across the United States was in 1918, three years after the last time the Brown football team was in a bowl game. Of course, now the only bowl games Brown is eligible for are flushing the Yale bowl and waiting in line forever to get a granola bowl at Andrews. Watch now as the Band finally gets its brunch (it only took 30 minutes!) and plays “Wake Me Up Before We Get to the Front of the Line.”

We think it’s pretty weird that you only have one building for all of your classes, Bryant. It’s like going to high school all over again, and who’d really want that. Here at Brown we have a single, elegant, icosaheptabicenta-structure. We’ve also heard some things about Bryant traditions, including that you walk through an arch to commemorate your graduation and avoid walking through it otherwise. We have at least four arches here at Brown and walk through them on a regular basis. By our calculations, this means that the average Brown student has graduated from Bryant approximately 500 times without ever entering the “Unistructure”. Watch now as the Band forms the newly renovated MoChamp Arch and graduates, yet again, from Bryant, and plays the Bryant fight song.

We’ve always felt a special bond with Bryant, being that we come from the same incredibly tiny state. However, when we went on your website, we immediately felt betrayed, since most of the pictures were not from our glorious Lil’ Rhody. Here’s a list of things found on the Bryant website that you can’t actually do in Rhode Island:

:::script-list

- A. Visit the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, or the Great Wall of China
- B. Walk with classmates in business casual
- C. Eat lunch with your professors
- D. Go white water rafting
- E. Experience good weather, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band forms the best grade Bryant could get in geography, and plays In Rhode Island.

We’ll see you in less than a Scaramucci at Harvard next Saturday. Brown Band out.
