Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has heard of Elf on the Shelf, it's the Brown University "now get ready for Bill Nye the Science Guy at URI" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Welcome back URI! It is so nice to finally be able to talk to you again considering last year...you know...when you forcibly recommended we not read our script. For an entire year we've been dying to ask you one question. Do you know what a bra is? We're not quite sure if you know, since one of your fans confused it with a baritone sax harness. Perhaps Victoria's real secret was that she didn't know what a bra was. Watch now as the Band forms the offending undergarment and plays Take Off Me Bra.

If you take a closer look at the Band today, you might notice some older faces. That's because our lovely alumni who are hopefully earning lots of money to donate to the Band have joined us today! Many things have changed since you were last here and we wanted to quickly fill you in. J. Walter Wilson locks its doors at 6pm, causing multiple students to walk into glass doors daily. There are two directions to the nighttime shuttle. And the Band now has melodicas! Watch now as the Band forms bags filled with donations from our doting alumni and plays You Belong To Brown Forevermore.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that dropped out of URI because of the egg sandwiches, it's the Brown University "there was a lack of egg and bread" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey there URI! We heard that this year you're celebrating your quasquicentennial. Congratulations! Orbiting the sun is always such hard work. We would know: we've done it twice as many times as you. In celebration, we have some suggestion for how to Imagine URI 125+:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. If you've got an extra twenty minutes lying around, travel all the way from one end of Rhode Island to the other to tell people the good news!</sli>
<sli>B. Serve hot weiners in the Butt, your esteemed dining hall </sli>
<sli>C. Finally beat out Uniform Resource Identifier as the Wikipedia page that pops up when you Google URI.</sli>
<sli>D. Toast to another 125 with an ice cold glass of Razzbull</sli>
<sli>E. Write some Google reviews that don't involve egg sandwiches, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>

So here we are at the 102nd Governor's Cup. Hey there Governor Raimondo--can we call you Gina? No? Okay that's fine too. We just had a quick question for you. What kind of cup exactly are you awarding tonight? A measuring cup? Dry measuring or liquid? A sippy cup? Perhaps a protective cup, for safety? Personally, we're fans of the red Solo kind. In any case, we consider ourselves blessed to be so close to something that Lincoln Chafee once touched. Watch now as the band celebrates the metric system and plays Crazily In Love with Easy Unit Conversions.

Here's a question for you, Brown sports fan: have you ever seen URI and UNC in the same room? That's right. You haven't. Is UNC just URI in a slightly-lighter Keaney Blue trench coat? Could it be, as ancient astronaut theorists suggest, that UNC's Ramses VI and Rhody, the URI ram, are in fact the same ram? Who's to say! And Oozeball, URI's beloved muddy volleyball game, do they play at UNC as well? You can't prove they don't. Watch now as the Band forms the grade this conspiracy theory would receive and is either a Rhode Islander, Tar Heel, or Brunonian born.
