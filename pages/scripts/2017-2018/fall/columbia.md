## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and Alumno, presenting an organization that always wins, it's the Brown University "and our fan is happy about it too!" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

After traveling from Brown University in the City of Providence, we were looking forward to playing your historically underperforming football team. Apparently, that's not the case this year. It seems like we're not the only ones disappointed to discover this. Here's a list of opinions held by alumno of Columbia College in the City of New York regarding having a winning football team:

:::script-list

- A. "Very pleasantly unsettling,"
- B. "I no longer need to be hip and ironic,"
- C. "My Columbia was a happily bohemian place and I wish it were still,"
- D. "Tread softly and carry a big stick,"
- E. "Alexander Hamilton. My name is Alexander Hamilton," and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band makes it less quiet uptown and plays the entire soundtrack of Hamilton... simultaneously. :sd[Sing Hamilton intro].

So Columbia, we wanted to have a talk with you about your band. We heard that back in 1973 the Columbia Band got into a brawl with the Harvard Band over "the alleged attempted theft" of the Harvard Band's bass drum. Now far be it from the Brown Band to condemn such actions, but if you're going to do it, you have to do it right. Like we did. While you guys had a brawl that was a bit forceful, we chose to fight with state troopers instead. Our weapon of choice was lawyers, not fists. At least we can both agree that Harvard's bass drum is absurd and needs to be confiscated.

Watch now as the band travels back to 1966 and gets suspended from Columbia for an infamous birth control field show, and plays Hooked on Safe And Accessible Contraceptives.

Honestly, the Brown Band is just the top-ranked band in the Ivy League. Alphabetically.\

Here's a list of some other things we've done better than you:

:::script-list

- A. Getting banned from Holy Cross. (We did it a week earlier.)
- B. Staying unbanned from West Point for longer
- C. Pretending to be another band -- We were such a good Brown Band, Cornell fans thought we were the Cornell Band pretending to be the Brown Band!
- D. Making B's on the field... if you know what I mean ;^)
- E. Ice skating with Michelle Kwan's blessings, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the Band forms a B on the field (wink wink) and plays a Better Cheering Song.

And with that the Brown Band is done with football season. And what a season it has been. (It was Fall.) Catch you in Providence as the band dons boots with blades attached to the bottom for the Providence arboreal illumination ceremony. Brown Band out.
