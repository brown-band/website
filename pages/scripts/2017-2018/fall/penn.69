Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that knows what's scarier than Halloween, it's the Brown University "So what are your plans after graduation?" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
Instead of donning our usual red polos, brown blazers, and Old Navy khakis, the Brown Band has dressed up to celebrate one of the spookiest events of the year: the Penn football game. The University of Pennsylvania is the embodiment of all the scariest things in this world. For example, just look at their alumni list. Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Tiffany Trump. Wait, I think I'm starting to see a pattern. This year we're taking inspiration from Penn and carving the most terrifying Jack-o'-Lanterns. They include the White House, Twitter, and the Phillies record this past season. Watch now as the Band forms the spookiest number and plays the spookiest song.

We recently learned that Penn students who take Microecon 001 gather at midnight on the eve of the first midterm for a collective scream. Coincidentally, the Brown Band has a similar tradition. On the Eve of the annual Penn football game, we gather on the Main Green to scream at the prospect of interacting with the Quakers. Here's a list of things that are almost as scary as Penn students:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. The state of American politics</sli>
<sli>B. Organic chemistry</sli>
<sli>C. Going to Jo's past midnight on a Saturday</sli>
<sli>D. Rogue toast throwing</sli>
<sli>E. Networking, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
<sd>Ghost noises</sd> So spoopy! Watch now as the Band invites you to be our connection on LinkedIn and plays Burnt Multigrain Bread.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's using *NYSNC songs to cope with our feelings, it's the Brown University "bye bye bye (bye bye!)" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>

We know we've already talked about plenty of spooky things today, but here's one last Halloweekend fright for you, Brown sports fan: It's our last game this season at Brown Stadium, and the last game our seniors will play here! Watch now as the Band raises a glass to our beloved seniors. COMMENCE WITH THE LIMERICKING.

<i>Iuliu's toughened from the frozen wasteland<sbr/>

Great shows he's helped us discover<sbr/>
"Lift with jerking motion" he advises the Band</i>

<i>We'll miss our historian, Greer<sbr/>

<sp>
<i>Tom Brady is Matt Finn's best thrill,<sbr/>

<i>Katie Hay, a great snare drum beater,<sbr/>

</sp>
<sp>
<i>Dana Leichter, Grand Poobah of all,<sbr/>

</sp>
<sp>
<i>Francesca has written, teehee.<sbr/>
Lots of jokes for you and for me.<sbr/>
L.I.'s her dominion, <sbr/>
Don't show her a minion<sbr/>
She'll dismantle the patriarchy!</i>
</sp>
<sp>
<i>Our fave Slytherin Carol Medina<sbr/>
Who loves her companion named TINA<sbr/>
She carries low brass<sbr/>
With sass and with class<sbr/>
Tuba goddess, we don't need Athena</i>

<i>All bow to Sammy our queen<sbr/>
Of biology, bones, tea, and meme<sbr/>
Never contrarian,<sbr/>
Quite the librarian,<sbr/>
Leads the drums in Ooh ahh, Jamamie</i>

"My Chem knowledge is fleeting,<sbr/>
My hairline's receding,<sbr/>
Why should I even get out of bed?" </i>
</sp>
<sp>
<i>At bandquet Max wears a disco suit <sbr/>
He often takes detours en route <sbr/>
When the quarterback throws<sbr/>
He screams "Let's [bleep]ing GOOOOOOO" <sbr/>
And on alto sax he does toot.</i>
</sp>

The GCB will keep him coming back </i>
</sp>
<sp>
<i>Zach Woessner is a gangly fellow,<sbr/>
You can say he's quite a mello,<sbr/>
His script-reading's lit<sbr/>

Does he have bones or is he just jello?</i>
</sp>
<sp>
<i>Oh outro, you are really swell. <sbr/>
You always make us leave well. <sbr/>
Whenever you come on,<sbr/>
We know we can't be on. <sbr/>
Uhhh, bye.</i>
