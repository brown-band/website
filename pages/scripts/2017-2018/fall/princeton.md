## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that hopes their family brought dogs too, it's the Brown University "let's not disgrace our families" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Dear family members,\

We have gathered you here today to give you The Talk. We of course mean your irresponsible usage of memes. To help you get hip with the youths, here's a list of things you should not do on the Internet:

:::script-list

- A. Share Minion memes. They're just not funny.
- B. Write a negative Yelp review because the food was too spicy
- C. Share conspiracy theories -- no, Mom, the government isn't listening to you from your microwave
- D. Check in on Facebook from the break room
- E. Overshare, and
- F. The Princeton Band

:::

Watch now as the Band forms a minion and plays Shut Down Your Computer and Dance.

We'd love for all of you to stay the night, but unfortunately we already made some plans. Apparently the brilliant Ivy League minds of the class coordinating board decided that, well, who wouldn't want to bring their family to a semi-formal dance? Perhaps we should change the name from A Night on College Hill to A Night of Lying to our Family on College Hill. Watch now as the Band forms their semi-formal best and plays Bring my Parents to the Party.

See you at halftime.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that eats Tony the Tiger for breakfast, it's the Brown University "football is GRRRREAT" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hey Princeton, how was your summer? We really enjoyed heading to our state beaches on the Fourth of July. What's that? Yours were closed? Now who would do such a thing?! Definitely not failed presidential candidate Chris Christie of Bridgegate fame. In any case, we hope for your sake that he's less hypocritical as a sports radio host than as a governor. Watch now as the Band accosts baseball fans while cradling their nachos, and plays Defunct-y Beach Town.

So Princeton, we realized we've never had a chat with you about one of your most noteworthy alums -- Mr. Zodiac Killer himself, Rafael Edward Cruz '92. We've heard that he's been up to some...interesting...things online lately. Now that Twitter is used for things like official presidential announcements and threats to Rocket Men, you'd think Teddy would know better than to "like" certain types of adult content. He should take a page from the Brown Band's social media playbook. After all, we did get Michelle Kwan to agree to give us skating lessons. Watch now as the Band forms the Twitter bird and plays Born to Tweet.

In the land of Halloween and squirrels, Princeton truly understands how to run a university. For example, buying 42 chairs made from recycled plastic milk containers for only $700 a piece! What a steal! At Brown you could buy almost 117 spicies with for the price of one of those hunks of plastic. So where did Princeton get all this money from? Probably from "accidentally" charging double tuition to a bunch of families. Oops. Watch now as the Band forms a BILLION DOLLARS and pays tuition for Bruno and for Brown.

Catch us next week at Cornell, where we will say only good things about Cornell, its alumni, and the beautiful city of Ithaca. Brown Band out.
