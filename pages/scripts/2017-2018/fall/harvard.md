## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that hasn't lost to URI... this year, it's the Brown University "we'll see what happens next week" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Harvard, we need to have a talk. You lost to URI last week. Now as the only team present who is actually from Rhode Island, we would like to point out that losing to URI is our sole purview. We don't need you Massachussetts people coming in and taking our jobs. Maybe we need to institute a Rhode Island First policy. You losing to Rhody is the worst deal in the history of deals, possibly ever. Watch now as the band enacts some protectionist legislation and plays Rhode Islanders Are All In This Together.

Football. Is this what you came for? Of course not, you came here for Rihanna! Shoutout to you people for giving our queen the 2017 Harvard Humanitarian Award she deserves. But why stop there? You should give Rihanna your entire endowment. No, what about erect a statue of her? Wait, why not just name the entire university after her? The Brown Band has already properly honored her by naming one of our sections after her hit song, S\&M. Watch now as the Band honors Rihanna's home of Barbados and plays For Rihanna, and For Brown.

Catch us at halftime, when we will honor some of Harvard's great alumni.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that didn't buy its way into the Ivy League, it's the Brown University "please meme responsibly" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

So we hear you're looking for a new president. We would like to present, for your consideration, our dear friend Elrod T. Snidley. He's proven to be a strong candidate in the past. In Brown's 1988 University Council of Students election, he won nearly half of the vote as a write-in candidate. Vote for Snidley - he won't do diddley! Elrod would also bring a lot to Harvard's campus, most specifically, his trumpet and bass drum. His drum is much more practically sized than the one we see floating around here that we tried to steal back in the '70s, since he doesn't have to overcompensate. Watch now as the Band forms Elrod's superior bass drum, and plays I'm A Believer in Elrod.

We'd like to thank your esteemed alumnus, Jared Corey Kushner '03, for single-handedly solving the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict through the power of real estate development. Here is a list of his other greatest accomplishments:

:::script-list

- A. Buying his way into Harvard (shout out to Daddy Kush for the small donation of $2.5 million)
- B. Marrying his way into the White House
- C. Buying his way through Harvard
- D. Executing a successful Russian outreach program during the 2016 campaign
- E. Finally reversing the anti-nepotism legacy of Lyndon B. Johnson, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the Band gets admitted to Harvard despite their subpar grades, and plays Get Into Harvard, My Wayward Son.

Hey Spicey. This one's for you. We heard that you were recently named a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School. So you accepted Harvard but declined Dancing with the Stars. Clearly your priorities need some readjustment, especially regarding your household food preservation appliances. So Harvard, a word of advice. Be sure to lock up your mini-fridges before Spicey gets here. Also Melissa McCarthy might have been a better choice than that guy, just saying. Watch now as the band forms two bushes for Sean Spicer to hide in and plays Bring Back The Mini-Fridges.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Bring the Victory.]

We'll see you back at home next Saturday when we take on URI.
