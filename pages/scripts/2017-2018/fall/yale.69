Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that likes to move it move it, it's the Brown University "When will Madagascar 4 come out?" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We would like to welcome the arrival of two new residential colleges at Yale: Benjamin Franklin and Pauli Murray. With new colleges come with new traditions and chants. However, we were a bit disappointed to learn that the result of the "Great Mascot Reveal of 2017" was a lemur. We have a better idea. Elrod Snidley. With a large bass drum in one hand and a trumpet in the other, Elrod is the epitome of all that is "cool" and "charming" just like the Brown Band. Watch now as the Band forms a lemur's tail and plays Every Little Thing We Do Is Charming.

Speaking of Pauli Murray, we happened to read a column in the Yale Daily News written by a student from this particular college. And it really got us thinking about how we still don't have empathy for the privileged. Why you so mad, Bront? No one's going to feel bad that you're a triple legacy student with a timeshare in Disney World. Listen here Brent, there are people here with real problems who aren't worried about whether or not their new Macbook makes them an elitist. Grow up. Watch now as the Band has no empathy Brett and plays For Canada Goose and For Macbooks.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that enjoys cardplaying, tavern-going, and acts of disobedience to college authorities, it's the Brown University "we'll never live up to Nathan Hale" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

As we're sure you all know, the Brown Band is well known for always being on our best behavior. It's not our fault that our best behavior is usually not good enough. Here's a list of things we definitely never got in trouble for in the mid-to-late twentieth century:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Talking about the military... at West Point,</sli>
<sli>B. Talking about Catholicism... at Holy Cross,</sli>
<sli>C. Stealing Harvard's mascot... at Harvard,</sli>
<sli>D. Transferring bari sax harnesses between players... at a school that doesn't know what a bra looks like,</sli>
<sli>E. Talking about Cornell... at Cornell. (That one may have actually been two weeks ago.), and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Watch now as the band most definitely does not steal a "Wet Paint" sign and plays Livin' On The Edge.

When in New Haven, the Brown Band always pays tribute to Marcel Breuer's 1968 brutalist masterpiece, the Armstrong Rubber Company aka the Pierelli Tire Building aka an Ikea we think? Whenever we crawl past New Haven on I-95, we're sure to take a moment to appreciate the "conspicuous void" separating one part of the building from another. We've heard it described as an "aesthetic innovation", but honestly, it just seems like a waste of a floor where you could have put a perfectly good Swedish meatball restaurant. Watch now as the Band "explores the plastic potential of concrete within a rational architectural order" and plays the Cars on I-95 are Evil.

We can't wait for hockey season to start, Yale, because we've heard that your hockey team has been "taking fitness to another level". We, too, have been working on our fitness. (Princeton Band's our witness.) (oooooh, weee)  Our Bandies put Yale bois on rock, rock. And they be lining down the field just to watch what we got. So delicious. Watch now as the Band honors Fergie's time in the Black Eyed Peas and plays In the Gym.

Catch us next week as we play D-to the-A-to the R-T-M-O-U-T-H at Fenway Park while sporting our Yankees caps. Brown Band out.
