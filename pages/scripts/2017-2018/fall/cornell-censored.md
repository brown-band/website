## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves reading from the banned book list, it’s the Brown University “I do not like green eggs and ham” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We’re always disappointed to hear that we play Cornell University in football, instead of Cornell College. If we traveled to the beautiful city of Mount Vernon, Iowa, we’d be more likely to encounter a sunny day -- it has an average 193 sunny days per year as compared to Ithaca’s measly 155. We’d also prefer to travel to a school with talent - the College has won TWO national wrestling team titles, while you have ZERO. At least we can visit Olin Library and pretend we’re in Iowa. Watch now as the Band salutes the Hawkeye State and plays Iowa Touch Myself.

But alas, here we remain in Ithaca, New York. Once known, according to Wikipedia, for its horse racing, gambling, profanity, Sabbath breaking, and readily available liquor, it’s now known only for readily available liquor and equestrian organic fluid. Google it. Additionally, Ithaca is one of the AARP’s 2012 quirkiest places to retire. So settle down, invest in some horses, and watch some Wheel of Fortune as you contemplate whether cows would have been a better deal. Watch now as the Band forms a B on the field and plays a Brown song from the early 1900s that you have probably never heard before.

See you at halftime where we will continue to say only good things about Cornell, its alumni, and the beautiful city of Ithaca.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is gorges, it’s the Brown University “I’d rather be fjords” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Wow all of this running around has made us famished. Time to whip out our trusty recipe for Cornell Chicken. What, never heard of it? Shameful! We’ll give you some tips straight from the Washington Post.

:::script-list

- A. The emulsion of vinegar, oil and eggs helps the chicken to crisp without burning as rapidly as it does with a red barbecue sauce
- B. No wood. Use charcoal. Wood gives it too much of a smoke flavor.
- C. Put unseasoned chicken halves skin side up in metal racks and turn them after a few minutes, when they begin to bronze.
- D. Liberally sauce the birds
- E. First, try smoking the chickens in a hole in the ground, as at a pig roast. Before long, you’ll figure out it’s easier to cook aboveground, which to be honest you probably should have thought of to start with, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the Band salutes chickens everywhere and plays The Chicken Dance.

Well Cornell, it’s been 20 years since the mysterious pumpkin appeared atop McGraw Tower, and you’re still no closer to figuring out who did it. The pumpkin inexplicably received widespread news coverage, which perhaps is more indicative of the lack of entertainment in the Southern Tier-Finger Lakes region of New York. This gourd, of course, has now been far surpassed as the most relevant pumpkin by The Honorable David S. Pumpkins. Watch now as the band asks if you have any questions and plays Johnny S. Pumpkins.

Oh! We nearly forgot! Happy homecoming to all the alumni (whom we are only saying good things about). We’re surprised we don’t see Andy Bernard here. Funny he never mentioned the moving statues any of the million times he brought up Cornell at Dunder-Mifflin. You know, the ones that move around at night. Watch now as the band honors another Cornell alum, the beloved Bill Nye the Science Guy, and plays Statue Moving Song.

Ann Coulter went to Cornell. Brown Band out.
