## Pregame

::script-note[Neither the pregrame nor the halftime script were actually read at the game, as we were unable to gain access to the Fenway Park PA system. <span class="d-print-none">Nevertheless, we felt that our script was too witty not to be read by all who visit our impeccably maintained website.</span>]

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves Smash Mouth, it’s the Brown University “at least we’re not in New Hampshire” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Dartmouth’s traditional Homecoming bonfire had several new additions this year including a chainlink fence and a water-filled plastic barrier. These changes were instituted after roughly 50 students attempted to touch the fire last year. We question whether Dartmouth students need to go to such extreme measures to warm themselves in the frigid lands of Hanover. Why not transfer or wait 50 years for the heat death of the universe? Watch now as the Band rejoins the Paris Climate Accord and plays The Inevitable Death of the Earth That I Get.

We’re sure is glad not to be in Hanover right now, where we’d certainly be frozen bandies. Hey Dartmouth, did you know there’s a Dartmouth, Massachusetts? For your safety, as well as Keggy’s, we’d recommend you migrate south this winter and resettle in the former home of Ezekiel Cornell, Ezra’s cousin. Watch now as the Band helps Dartmouth wave goodbye to the frozen wasteland of New Hampshire and plays the Brown Band is Cold.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s ready to play ball, it’s the Brown University “take me out to the ball game” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We’re so excited to be at the historic Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox. Baseball is the Brown Band’s third favorite sport behind squash and throwing a piece of paper into the garbage can across the room. But how can we mention the Boston Red Sox without mentioning their greatest rival of all time: the New York...Mets. This competition has existed for over 100 years and it’s about time these two teams grow from rivals to lovers. We can almost hear the wedding bells. Watch now as the Band recreates the fiercest rivalry in baseball and plays a tribute to Major League Baseball.

When we looked up Fenway on Wikipedia, we noticed that quite a few elements of the ballpark were notable landmarks, like “Pesky’s Pole”, or “The Triangle”, located a convenient 420 feet from home plate. But our favorite landmark of all has to be The Green Monster. It reminds us of our trusty local airport, T.F. Green International Airport. Here’s a list of some other green monsters, which we like a little bit less than this wall.

Boston is home to several other sports teams including the Celtics, Bruins, and of course, the Patriots. Tom Brady, if you’re out there, we have some words for you. You may have a lot of rings, but we certainly have more buttons than you. We also don’t know why you’re always called the “goat”, because you’re clearly a human. Unless you’re a goat that’s wearing a really lifelike human costume. Also, as students of Brown University, we’d like to point out that we’re strong believers in following the regulations of the Academic Code (unless you’re a computer science concentrator). Watch now as the Band forms defective athletic equipment and Brings Questionable Victory.

Catch us next week as we head to The City that Shall Not Be Named. Brown Band out.
