## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves reading from the banned book list, it’s the Brown University “I do not like green eggs and ham” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Every year we are always disappointed to hear that we aren’t playing Cornell College in football. If we traveled to the beautiful city of Mount Vernon, Iowa, we’d be able to speak without the eyes of Big Brother watching us! This College has won TWO national wrestling team titles. Neat, right? We thought so, which is why it’s in our script. At least we can pretend we’re in the middle of nowhere...Watch now as the Band is double plus ungood and plays Iowa Touch Myself.

Making a script is hard. Rewriting a script is even harder. How is a script born you may ask? Well it’s when a group of Brown Bandies love each other very dearly and and vigorously consume falafel wraps in the Ivy Room. Most of the time we like to poke fun at the Ivy League and ourselves, but sometimes we cannot for reasons we cannot publicly disclose. Watch now as the Band forms a B on the field and plays a Brown song from the early 1900s that you have probably never heard before.

See you at halftime after we finish writing this script under the watchful eye of the Ministry of Truth.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is gorges, it’s the Brown University “I’d rather be fjords” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Wow all of this running around has made us famished. Time to whip out our trusty recipe for roast chicken, or as we like to call it, Rob Lowe chicken. What, never heard of it? Shameful! Here, we’ll give you some tips:

:::script-list

- A. The emulsion of vinegar, oil and eggs helps the chicken to crisp without burning as rapidly as it does with a red barbecue sauce.
- B. No wood. Use charcoal. Wood gives it too much of a smoke flavor.
- C. Put unseasoned chicken halves skin side up in metal racks and turn them after a few minutes, when they begin to bronze.
- D. Liberally sauce the birds.
- E. First, try smoking the chickens in a hole in the ground, as at a pig roast. Before long, you’ll figure out it’s easier to cook aboveground, which to be honest you probably should have thought of to start with, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Does Halloween come to upstate New York? We’re not quite sure ourselves. We’ve seen cows and horses and lots of silos, but we haven’t seen a pumpkin yet. Definitely not a mysterious pumpkin that may have once appeared on top of a tower. I wonder if Winston Smith has ever seen a pumpkin? This gourd, of course, has now been surpassed as the most relevant pumpkin by The Honorable David S. Pumpkins. Watch now as the band asks if you have any questions and plays Johnny S. Pumpkins.

It was strongly suggested that we, the humble travelers from lil’ Rhody, provide some updates from Brown for our own team’s enjoyment. Brown is launching a new morning newsletter, Today@Brown, and is officially killing off our beloved Morning Mail. In a so-called “new approach to important campus information, . . . Brown is aligning with best practices in higher education by moving toward a more unified approach to campus communications.” We scriptwriters are also aligning with best practices in campus communications by streamlining our words to be as vague as possible. Watch now as the Band takes a “phased approach” and plays Email Deleting Song.

Emma Watson went to Brown. Brown Band out.
