Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is hoping finals will go away if we plug our ears, it’s the Brown University "lalalalalalalalala" Band!

We’re hoping you’re having a great Tuesday morning – or "Spring Weekend Eve", whichever you prefer. We thought we’d show up and spread a little cheer. After all, it’s almost almost finals, which means it’s also pre-pre Spring Weekend, so it’s okay to get in the spirit. Whether or not you’re feeling festive, watch now as the band Carries On With Its Nonsense, Son.

Don’t you wish we were in the SciLi playing "Jingle Bells" right now? For some reason, people seem to love it when we play in the libraries during finals period, so we’re back with all the hits for your morning commute :sd[plays one bar of Jingle Bells [badly]] – just kidding! Here are all the real hits:

:::script-list

- A. Memes about reslife, PLMEs, and Chicken Finger Friday
- B. That moment when your roommate is right behind you getting to your door and you don’t have to get out your keys
- C. Someone in the ratty with a plate full of nothing but grilled chicken and hard-boiled eggs
- D. Blueno’s fashionable new scarf
- E. "Brown Bear," Brown University’s very own official polka song, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band makes an appeal to win back your favor and plays We Want Your Love Back.

I don’t know about you folks, but the end of the semester is starting to make me a little nervous: getting intermediate deadlines on final projects? Those emails from Career Services saying "it’s not too late: find an internship!" What? Are we supposed to think it’s too late? IS IT TOO LATE? And on top of that, we’re losing our many beloved seniors who are going on to beautiful new lives? (\*sobby voice\*) WITHOUT US????

It’s okay, we’ll gain a lot of first-years! In the meantime, watch now as the Band realizes our bodies aren’t real and time is an illusion and plays Youth is Ever Fleeting from Brown.

We would make a joke here, but we’re doing this S/NC. Brown Band Out.
