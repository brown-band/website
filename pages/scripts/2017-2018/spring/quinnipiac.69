Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just has a lot of feelings, it's the Brown University "she doesn't even go here anymore" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>

Why hello there everyone. We're back from our undersea adventure and ready to take to the ice again with the elderly... I mean our alumni. There are a few things we need to catch them up on so they can be hip with the youths. For one, our favorite early morning friend, Brown Morning Mail, has gone to the great listserv in the sky. Instead, we have Today@Brown, a nearly identical daily news digest, but now with prettier formatting! Yay technology! For another, inflation has brought the value of a meal credit up to a whopping $7.90. What's next, EIGHT DOLLARS?? Preposterous.

Watch now as the Band mourns Brown Mo(u)rning Mail and plays I Want Morning Mail Back.

Quinnipiac is nestled in the heart of Connecticut, home to lax bros and nutmeg, apparently. <sbr/>
Here is a list of questions Google search suggested we ask about Connecticut:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Connecticut: why was it founded? </sli>
<sli>B. Connecticut: who's in jail?</sli>
<sli>C. Why is biodiversity important?</sli>
<sli>D. Why is Connecticut so haunted?</sli>
<sli>E. Connecticut is in which state? And</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>

This is our final ice show of the semester, and we're feeling pretty conflicted about it. On the one hand, it will feel nice to get back on solid ground and stop falling on our faces, but don't we look so graceful (at least right up until the moment we fall on our faces)? We're especially glad to have our alumni here tonight to support us â€“ no, literally, can you give me a hand? I'm about to fall. It's been AN ICE TIME skating, but we'll leave it to the hockey players now, at least until next year. But first, watch as the band gets in Over Our Head and plays In The Fray.

Catch us next weekend in the frozen wasteland as we follow our men's hockey team to Colgate and Cornell. Brown Band out.
