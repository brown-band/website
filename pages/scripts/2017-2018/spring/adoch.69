Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves stable emulsions of oil, egg yolk, and either vinegar or lemon juice, it's the Brown University "yes mayonnaise is an instrument!" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
Welcome to Brown! We hope you've had a great time so far. There's a long lineup for this show tonight, and all of these groups are full of awesome people, but the band is waaaayyyy better! We get to travel round and round, watch a ton of losing sportsball, and play goofy music - all while wearing the hottest trend to sweep 2018: khakis, polos, and blazers.

The only downside to the free travel to all these other Ivy Leagues is going to other Ivy Leagues that aren't Brown. Here are some of the things we miss while we're away:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Eating way too many chicken fingers at chicken finger Friday</sli>
<sli>B. Playing cheerful 8am wake-up songs for all of Brunonia on Parent's weekend</sli>
<sli>C. The axolotl in the Sci-Li</sli>
<sli>D. Making PLME memes on BDSM</sli>
<sli>E. Blueno, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>

Clearly, these reasons alone will convince you that there's no place like Brown. Watch now as the Band forms the nose (or is it a smile?) of the sun from Brown's crest that is eyeing you from above the stage and plays We Want You All Here Together.

You may be wondering how a group of people this uncoordinated managed to finagle our way into a dance showcase. The answer: we impressed them with all of the dance words we know. Pli√©. Pirouette. Shuffle. Nae Nae. Salsa. Guacamole. Time Step. Time Warp. Tendue. Jazz square. Jazz hands. Body roll. Box step. Boxing. The worm. Doctor Worm.

Clearly we are experts at this. Watch now as EVERYBODY DANCES NOW and plays The Dance-y Dance Song.
