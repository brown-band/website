Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that thinks it better down where it's wetter, it's the Brown University "Chef Louis just wanted a nice crab dinner" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

For those of you who don't speak lobster, welcome to the Brown Band's Under the Sea ice show. For those of you who only speak whale, <sd>whale voice from Finding Nemo</sd> welcome to the Brown Band's Under the Sea ice show.
</sp>
<sp>
Watch now as the Band salutes all our lobster/whale hybrid friends and plays Whale Lobster.

We're a little bit confused. We were told to embody the theme of "Under the Sea," but then when we got here, we were also on ice? Which one is it? Is this some kind water/ice combination? Like maybe a SlurpeeTM? If so, we demand blue-raspberry flavored ice, which is objectively the only acceptable variety. How else could you get the entire inside of your mouth to be that bizarre blue color? Watch now as the band embodies the spirit of the slightly-too-gnarly surfers who rode similarly textured icy waves during the BOMB CYCLONE and plays the soundtrack of wave riders everywhere.

<sd>Band forms Seaweed and plays I Get Around.</sd>

<sli>B. At the bottom of the lake next to Hogwarts, guarded by the giant squid,</sli>
<sli>C. Norway... obviously</sli>
<sli>D. At the Kennedy Space Center in Florida</sli>
<sli>E. Under the ice of Meehan Auditorium!!!!!!!!!!!!! (*the entire band stamps on the ice to try to break through*), and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Watch now as the Band goes on a magnificent journey and plays In Atlantis.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms two lines and counterskates to In the Fray</sd>

Catch us next week as we take to the ice again (this time with the elderly) when the hockey team takes on a team whose approval rating is consistently lower than Connecticut traffic's, Quinnipiac. Brown Band out.<sbr/>
