The Brown Band dedicates this show to the class of ’64 and their parents. This year’s freshman class comes to a Brown University which presents a strikingly different picture than in previous years. Along with its intellectual growth, there have been many concrete examples of change. The Band now presents a few of these changes.

A rather large concrete change on campus is the new, white library. The curious freshman wonders : what type of material is behind these walls? Could this giant television set be the answer?

Everyone recognizes that tie most important change of all is the high intellectual standard of this year's freshman class as symbolized by the eyeglasses formed on the field. fortunately, Saturday night finds the Brown freshman no different from any of his predecessors. Watch his reaction to the typical local girl.
