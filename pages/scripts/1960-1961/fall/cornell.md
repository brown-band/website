In honor of Homecoming Weekend, The Brown Band salutes two outstanding athletic achievements of the past year.

:sd[Jump into Pumpkin]

During the past summer, the ‘Cinderella’ Crew, as represented by the pumpkin formed on the field, performed notably in the Dad Vail Regatta, the I.R.A. Championships, and the Olympic Trials. As if by magic, this pumpkin was transformed into a sleek, award-winning shell.

Not <u>at</u> all wet this year is the Cross-Country Team. The Band salutes the success and dedication of these hard-working Bruins.

The Brown Band now takes pleasure in presenting the Homecoming Queen.
