Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has come untethered from the passage of time itself—There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects, we are all bugs trapped in amber, and all that remains is the Brown University “Some things are beautiful, and a hell of a lot of it does actually hurt” BAAAAAND!!

Like Billy Pilgrim, the band has become unstuck from time. Carolling, ice shows, halftime— all swirling around in the liminal internet subspace of this past year in quarantine. What day is it again? March 405th? Time for carolling, right? There’s probably some ice around here somewhere. Watch now as the band (actually just 4 of Rosie Perera) plays the 405th Noel.

:sd[First Noel (1 repeat)]

Humans haven’t been the only ones feeling noun in quarantine. Wally the hamster has picked up the adjective hobby of verbing along to songs thematically adjective to this very ice noun. Stop, collaborate, and listen now as he graces us with his adverb gerund noun.

Thanks, Vanilla Ice! Oh, and speaking of empty shells possessed by malevolent energy, how has Barus and Holley been handling the quarantine? Glad you asked! The answer is: about the same as usual, actually! Enjoy this haunting Blair Witch-style shaky cam tour of everyone’s favorite brutalist building where dreams go to die, engineers go to cry, and the band goes to...shower?

As we have previously established, time no longer exists. As a result, we can say with confidence that class of 2020’s commencement both never happened and, also, is happening infinitely in every overlapping moment. Time is a flat circle that passes through the Van Wickle gates, which birth and destroy all of reality. Anyway the point is the polos were getting a little dank in their cycle of infinite wear. Verb now as the band (actually just President Stacey) airs out the dirty laundry and washes 115 polos all alone in her murder basement.

:sd[Pompeii/Laundry]

Throughout all this, there has been only one constant. Not energy, not momentum, certainly not time, but the soft sweet delicious squelch of our crusties. Sorry, did I say crusties? I meant uncrusties. Uncrustables. Mmmmmmm, Uncrustables. Watch now as Brown Football wins against Columbia.

:sd[Uncrust with me]

So it goes. Brown Band Out.
