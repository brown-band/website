Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s getting a repetitive strain wrist injury, and not from anything fun, it’s the Brown University “How Long Has My Camera Been On” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We recognize that it can be difficult to keep track of rapidly updating health guidelines in this time of global crisis. In response, we came together - or at least within a few minutes of each other - to give you this comprehensive list of critical public health recommendations:

:sd[video should be vaguely related to each list item; mess around w it]

:::script-list

- A. Lick your hands.
- B. 6 feet is roughly the length of a fully extended trombone, so keep that slide well lubricated
- C. Since you can’t kiss someone on the mouth, try a different pair of lips.
- D. Try to retain a sense of normalcy by breaking into your favorite restaurant to just... sit for a while
- E. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, mouthpieces, and genitalia, and
- F. The Princeton Band

:::

Slap a mask on your clarinet, disinfect your insides with a hearty swig of Everclear, and watch now as the band empties its spit valves into a biohazard bin and plays Everytime We See Each Other, It’s At the CDC’s Recommended Distance of 6 Feet.

:sd[band plays Every Time We Touch]

Always cover your cock in public. Brown Band Out.
