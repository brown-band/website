## Pregame

:script-note[5 min scriptwriting concluded: we just want to release this and let anybody who wants to do the video film it according to their own vision]

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization whose very existence is its own brand of abstinence, it’s the Brown University “It works ninety-nine point nine percent of the time” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

It is now our distinct pleasure to welcome the Holy Cross Crusades to Brown. I mean Crusaders - to Brown. Wait I mean - yeah no that’s actually what they’re called. The Holy Cross Crusaders for social justice and human life. That’s literally what the March 2018 [press release](https://www.holycross.edu/crusader-moniker-and-mascot/update-crusader-imagery) says.\
Anyway: We’ve been a bad, bad band this year and we’re finally ready to beg for forgiveness. And by that I mean we’d like to take a tip from Lori Laughlin and buy a few indulgences. Daddy, forgive us our sins, for we have a campus bar that stays open for more than three hours a week. And let’s not forget that thing that happened back in the eighties.\
Watch now as the band justifies another Holy War and plays Make Everyone A Believer.

:sd[Band forms X and plays I’m A Believer.]

Now that we have your land - I mean attention, we’d like to recite a, shall we say, colorful story. Today’s reading? Daniel, Chapter 10, verses 5-6.

> Then I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz. His body also was like beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like the color of polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.

Watch now as the band reminds everyone that Jesus wasn’t white, and plays Brown Man Born.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Brown Man Born.]

Catch us at halftime when we eat the buddy of Chris (his name’s Larry) and wash it down with a sip of the Holy Sprite.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’d like to give Holy Cross’s new dining hall robots a call, it’s the Brown University “patron saint of salad tossing” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Come in Holy Cross - the Crusades are over. And while you were busy mapping out the desert, we were doing some exploring of our own, and we’d like to share some of our newfound Protestant wisdom. It seems like you really need an outlet: most schools your age don’t call themselves the Crusaders, and they definitely don’t name their newspapers after phallic vegetables. And we’re a little confused why our Google results keep suggesting lists of Catholic women under 40. Is there anything you want to talk about?\
Watch now as the band shows you all what you’re missing and plays I Touch Myself.

:sd[Band forms X and plays I Touch Myself.]

After we got excommunicated, we found these crazy cool golden plates in the ground. God says we can’t show them to you, but we’re totally starting a brand-new church in Utah. Here’s a few changes that we would like to include in our new online denomination:

:::script-list

- A. The Flying Spaghetti Monster
- B. Spiritual nudism (nakey nakey please don’t come in)
- C. Televangelism with extra special effects
- D. Several Clones of Tom Cruise
- E. Predestination and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band burns in Hell, Michigan 41869 (nice) and plays, through the fire and the flames, Through the Fire and the Flames

:sd[Band forms Flaming Hellscape and plays Through the Fire and the Flames.]

After an angry mob drove our merry band out of town, we decided that it was much safer to promote nihilism instead of any religion. There is a certain comfort in the realization that nothing really matters, not you or me, not anything we do, and certainly nothing that we have said so far. In the end, all you can do is look on the bright side of life, and laugh. Please don’t be mad at us.\
God is dead and we have killed him. All that matters now is nationalism. Watch now as the band proves a point and plays O Canada.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays O Canada.]

Nailed it. Brown Band Out.
