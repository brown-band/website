Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is currently being stood up by the Princeton Band and is alone at a table for two, it’s the Brown University “i just want to be served” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We know it’s Halloween, but did you have to ghost us? Honestly Princeton, what’s scarier than rejection? (wet socks) We are both getting up there in years, but we haven’t even hit the big 1-0-0! Have you left us for a younger, sprier band? Or maybe an older, more experienced band? It’s the Harvard Band, isn’t it? We get it, you’ve got a thing for oversized blazers. Fine. We hope you’re happy.\
You can at least offer us the courtesy of hearing a first reading of a love haiku for you, with a few edits in light of how it seems you really feel about us:

Napkin dispenser\
Went missing to clean up my\
Broken heart — uh oh

</center>

Alternately, here’s a breakup limerick:

There once were some bandies from joysey\
Who played all their instruments noisey\
They wore orange plaid\
And they made us quite sad\
Idaho, you’re a ho, Boise

That’s okay, Princeton. We’ll be just fine without you — we’ve already got our evening plans sorted out. Crazy, hyped up, insane plans! Lit plans! The best plans!! Pull out the TV Guide, grab a box of tissues, and watch now as the Brown Band plays I Clutch Myself To Sleep.

:sd[knocking?]\
:sd[princeton band enters]\
I don’t know how long I’ve been knocking at this door :’( Only this measly wooden board separates me from my beloved The The Brown Brown Band Band. I guess all I can do now is perform some freeform poetry. YoY

:sd[freeform poem w bongos]\
Door ...\
Made of wood ...\
Wood brown like ...\
My ...\
Beloved … Brown … band ...\
:sd[freeform yell]

Among all the stuffies and colors of the Ivy League\
You’re the one who has caught my intrigue\
You take the place of my favorite teddy\
I thought our relationship was so steady\
Yet now, I’m far from your brown-blazered embrace\
Will I never see your face?

But soft, what light thru yonder window breaks?\
Tis the east, and Holy Fuck It’s A Bear\
There’s a bear\
Does anyone else see the bear

And finally, in the words of first rate poets REO Speedwagon, We can’t fight this feeling anymore. We’ve forgotten what we’re fighting for. Uhh. Bears. Shore. Oar. Whatev-or. The Beatniks were on some strong stuff, it turns out. Poetry hard. Words bad. Joke machine run out. Boom, snap, clap, and watch now as the Brown and Princeton bands play The Heartfelt, Poetry-Based Confession That I Get

They only loved us for our bear....y cool personality. Brown and Princeton bands out.
