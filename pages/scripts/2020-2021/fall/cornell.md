“We welcome visiting bands to add to the event, but they must remove anything that has to do with Cornell (or neighbor institutions), the city of Ithaca, our student body, and support their team rather than criticize anything to do with our community. Our students, parents, alums and fans expect and deserve a professional atmosphere. Derogatory, explicit or vulgar statements will not be permitted. In addition, the content must be relevant to an athletic contest rather than a pointless rant.”

Hey, Cornell? I think we need to talk. And this time, it’s just you and us -- no AD, no :sd[LOUD CENSOR BEEP], no :sd[Black box over face of speaker], and none of that ‘we expect you to maintain a professional atmosphere’ nonsense either!

We could put up with the freaky brain collection you’ve got lying around, and even your weird obsession with your ‘neighboring institutions,’ despite all those... mumps cases at Syracuse last December -- but we have to draw the line somewhere. And that’s where you draw the lines. You’re just too... straight for us. We get it, plenty of people these days are into marching around in flashy uniforms, but we like our bands a little more scrambled. Not to mention the age difference.

Sure, you may be in “the beautiful city of Ithaca”, with its wonderful gorges, lakes and forests -- though we have to wonder why your lakes are the only finger action happening in this relationship -- more restaurants per capita than New York City, and a young, hip, Cornell-alumni mayor. And yes, we may be in the pothole-laden, fading industrial smellscape that is Providence, still polishing our political system in the wake of our most-famous mobster-mayor. But honestly, we think it’s all gone to your head.

Cornell, you must think you’re SOOO much better than we are, since you never care about what we have to say! Like last year—we sent you a perfectly good script and we all get back are corrections. How about, “Good Job Brown Band”? “Nice Jokes The Brown University Band”? “We’re Proud of You The Band of Brown University in the State of Rhode Island, est. 1924”? No, all you could see were insults. And they weren’t even insults to you - our whole script was ragging on Syracuse (admittedly in an attempt to damn you with faint praise) But this time, you’ve left us no choice, we absolutely have to tell you—\

Cornell, you are such a [redacted]. You [redacted] as if you’re even [redacted]. Your beautiful city of [redacted] is so [redacted]. And that’s not to mention the [redacted] and [redacted]. Like, seriously? You are nothing but a [redacted redacted redacted super redacted] motherfucker.

Okay. Thanks for listening. I’m glad we had this talk. I think you’ll agree it’s only fair that we get to keep the Bear mascot. Maybe you guys can be... uh... red. Or something. In the meantime we don’t think it’s too much to ask that you take a break from the Ivy League. For everybody’s sake. We were here first, after all, and things might be kind of awkward with the Princeton band.

Oh, didn’t you know? We’re totally F-ing.

Derogatory, explicit AND vulgar statements. Brown Band Out.
