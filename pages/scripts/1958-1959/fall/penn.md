Ladies and Gentlemen — introducing the Brown University Marching Band

:sd[Band, on “BBB,” forms car with wheels turning at midfield]

This is the 1958 version of the Wham-O V-39. This powerful modern car, actually the home of the American motoring public, demands powerful high octane gasoline, powerful accessories, powerful advertising, and a powerful bank account. This pulsating, vibrating monster was not always so powerful. In fact, it looked much more like the decrepit hulk you see on the field. The fist cars had four wheels (and not much else) and these wheels didn’t always go in the same direction. Eventually, though, the mechanical difficulties were straightened out.

:sd[Front wheels stop; front wheel turns in right direction; band plays “Merry Oldsmobile” with wheels turning slowly. When tune stops, wheels keep turning.]

New power was found in increased octane ratings, and with that our modern car came into being. Increased octane and high horsepower are fine things, but I’m not too sure that this car can take it — look at those wheels go! — <u>watch out, men</u>!

:sd[Loud noises from percussion, as car explodes into stick figure of man.]

Let’s face it, there’s nothing more dependable, nothing more trouble-free, nothing more economical than good old shanks mare.
