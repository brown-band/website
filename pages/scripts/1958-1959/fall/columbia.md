:sd[Band marks time while announcer reads]

This is the age of bigger and letter. Automobiles have grown so long one can barely park them. Movies, while they may not he better than ever, are certaily bigger than ever. The Brown University Band has long advocated small-screen half time shows, but progress is progress. The Band today proposes to stretch the football field out beyond its hundred yards. As a salute to Columbia, the Brown Band will form the largest lion ever created. Stand back, friends, put on your three-D glasses, and away we go.

:sd[Roll-off into BBB and step off after intro.]

:sd[When band has stopped]: And there you have it! A lion so large the field cannot hold him. His body is directly under the Columbia stands, and his legs extend into the field outside the stadium. unfortunately, only his tail is visible on the football field. :sd[Now he is shaking tail begins to way] … and how he paws the earth with his great claws! Too bad all you can see of this is his great tail wagging — but use your imaginations, friends — the field can hold no more

:sd[Roll off into “B” then block for Alma Mater.]
