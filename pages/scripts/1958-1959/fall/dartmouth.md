Ladies and Gentlemen — introducing the Brown University Marching Band.

:sd[Band, playing “Salutation,” marches to midfield. 2 drum cadences take Band into Atomium.]

The chief international event of the past summer was the World’s Fair in Brussels, Belgium. By way of saluting this event the band has formed the Giant Atomium, central structure of the fair.

:sd[Band plays “Thunder Song.” 2 drum cadences take band Into American Pavilion.]

Now let’s move on to this American pavilion. The exhibits contained in this building covered every aspect of American life, but the most popular attraction was the program of performing arts. America was represented last summer by symphony orchestras, opera, ballet and jazz groups. Brown University’s contribution to this field of jazz was it’s own Brunotes, back from their European triumphs they appear here today, here they are — the Brunotes.

:sd[Band and Brunotes play “Washington and Lee Swing.” 2 drum cadences take band into crown.]

The crown that the Band has formed indicates that it’s time for that traditional and long-awaited homecoming ceremony.
