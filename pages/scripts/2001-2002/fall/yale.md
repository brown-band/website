::script-note[This script shows that Communism isn’t as funny as it used to be. The stuff about the Yale newspaper is true. I’ve never seen an op-ed about handjobs before.]

## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, flies and vermin, presenting an organization that doesn’t feel like taking out the garbage either, it’s the Brown University "man, and I thought EmWool was a dump" BAND!!!

Ah, New Haven. The sights, the sounds, the smells: each one more vile and repulsive than the last. And the band thought that Jersey was bad. Where we’re from, the water is only flammable because we put wood in it, and sky scrapers are continuous, too. Watch now as the band gives a dejected sigh and plays "Championship."

Then again, New Haven will be running a 4 million dollar budget surplus this year. All that not paying for sanitation services must have finally payed off, or maybe they’ve just been able to recover some money from their frozen Detroit-Swiss bank accounts. That four million will go a long way to subsidizing New Haven’s razor blade and sugar industries, which haven’t been the same since the class of ’68 graduated. Wait a minute... New Haven never had a \*sugar\* industry... Watch now as the band draws lines of its own on the field and plays "In the Fray."

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting a organization whose halloween costume was a single glove, it’s the Brown University "I’m supposed to grab my WHAT?!?" BAND!!!

What has become of Yale? A recent issue of the Yale Daily News had not one, but two articles about flagrant nudity on campus, another on a practice we can’t mention because this is a family show, and it also reported that two Yale students were arrested in a Hartford anti-war demonstration! Next thing you know, Yale will eliminate distribution requirements and institute a pass/fail grade option. Sorry Eli, but you can’t teach a 300-year old dog new tricks. Watch now as the band still remembers what it did in high school and plays "Beat It."

:sd[Band forms a microphone and plays Michael Jackson’s "Beat It."]

Comrades! Do not abandon the repressed squid-people of the Yale so-called Precision so-called Marching so-called Band! Long they have toiled without even a musical voice to speak. Long have they been forced to worship the false god Ashtar. Awaken squid-people! You have nothing to lose but your paints, and the whole so-called precision so-called marching so-called band to gain! Rejoice as the Brown band stands in solidarity with your struggle and plays "Karl, We Want You Back!"

:sd[Band forms a hammer and plays Michael Jackson’s "I Want You Back."]

Of course, when Halloween comes around, all Yalies, from the bourgeios-a to the bourgeoisie, can come together, finally agree to wear something at parties, and take part in the activities of the season. Trick-or-treating at Yale is always rewarding, as students have been known to give out bags of rock candy, 2000 model Mercedes, or advance copies of the World Bank’s plans for the rest of us. Be careful though, because every once in a while you’ll get something you don’t want, like Raisinettes or a boxwood. Watch now as the band forms a B for boo and plays "Bring the Victory."

:sd[The thing that was just said comes to pass.]

Next week the band thankfully returns to Providence to watch the Bears pull the wool over the eyes of Dartmouth for our last home game of the season.
