## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni! Presenting an organization that’s too large to fit in the Governor’s Cup, it’s the Brown University “no I’m not going to drink out of that” BAND!!!

The Brown Band would like to welcome you to the first home game of the 2001 football season, the annual and epic struggle between Brown and URI that will decide who gets naming rights to the state for the next year. You may not know it, but while Brown Stadium was lovingly tended to by gnomes over the summer, the athletic department renovated Stevenson Field, which now has lights brighter than the class of 2005 and more foot-candles than even the Brown Band. Watch now as the band sacrifices a pig to bring our team the “Championship”

In addition to new lighting, the field sports a completely new surface and sub-surface, including such features as drainage pipes every 16 feet, trap doors into a bear pit to allow for gladiatorial combat, a 100-foot deep concrete barrier to keep out pesky burrowing nerds, and one smooth track. Watch now as the band forms a “B” for rooftop field and plays a song you all know and love, “‘URI, no wait, Brown, no, I think it’s URI, wait, on second thought we’re pretty sure it’s Brown’ Man Born”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni! Presenting an organization that was busy during the freshman sex talk, it’s the Brown University “this is for covering WHAT?!?” BAND!!!

It’s the beginning of the year, and Brown’s halls have been teeming with fresh-faced Engineers and Pre-meds named either Sarah or Michael. The upper classman is warned, however, because, come noon or 6PM, these innocent creatures become savage and territorial pack animals in migration to the Ratty or V-Dub, where their diet consists primarily of vegan brown rice pilaf and other delicacies. Nevertheless, they remain the best and brightest class of ravenous wolf-people to ever enter Brown. Watch now as the band forms a meal fit for a freshman and plays a song by “Reel Baked Scrod.”

Since coming to college, freshman are no doubt feeling the freedom and liberation of a full Brown education. From the top floors of our Sciences Library all the way down to your RC’s door, the opportunities for learning are limitless. Just be sure to let your roommate know when you’re studying in the dorm so he or she won’t accidentally disturb you. After all, that’s what friends are for, right? Watch now as the band lets everyone know what it’s up to tonight and plays “I’ll Be There For You.”

Unfortunately, having received no sense of direction from “Points on the Compass,” an entire flock of Perkins freshman got lost trying to find their way to SciLi’s 13th floor and ended up in such quaint New England towns as: Woonsocket, Pawtucket, Ophakett, Seakonk, Worchester, Cocukett, Attleburough, and Detroit. Watch now as the band forms the Brownsignal to guide them back to Brunonia’s soil and plays “Brown Forevermore.”

Come back next week when the Bears take on Fordham’s Rams at home and the Brown Band tries to incite a nationwide run on cricket wickets.
