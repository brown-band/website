## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that doesn't know anyone from New Jersey, it's the Brown University "but I thought I had my flu shot" BAND!!!

Well, it's the last game of the season, and time for reflection on how Brown Football has done this year. We've racked up more victories than defeats, which makes us happy, but we'll never forget out most important accomplishment: we \*won\* game number seven. Watch now as the band pulls out the pigskin one last time and plays "So Much for the Championship."

There's one thing that never changes here in Harlem. Whether it's Columbia students stressed from their required classes, secret service agents guarding Bill Clinton and Al Gore, or crazy street-people, everyone is walking around talking to someone who's not there. It's as if the entire campus has a James Stewert complex, just with a more annoying voice. Watch now as the band salutes its own animal pal and plays "Brown Bear."

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, brutish Columbia scriptwriters, presenting an organization that admits that eugenics has its perks, it's the Brown University "you want me to conceive WHAT???" BAND!!!

While it may be old news to New Yorkers, the Brown Band was quite disappointed when we heard that we wouldn't be able to see the show "Cats" after today's game. It seems that Broadway's bizarre human-feline genetic experiments have finally reached their conclusion, and the former stars, now inhuman cat-people monsters, are primed to invade and acquire the full extent of Columbia's base. In celebration of their resultant draconian fiefdom will be one hundred days of joy and merriment, the likes of which Columbia students have never seen. Planned festivities include gladiatorial combat against the Columbia band, readings from the Federalist papers, pass/fail classes, and a heavy metal concert. Main screen turn on to see the band erect a Big Top over Columbia's entire gated community and play "Karn Evil 9."

Of course, there's more to Columbia than what's inside the gates: there's the whole vibrant community of Harlem just beyond the barbed wire, full of wonders and curiosities unmatched by even TS Eliot's opiotic ramblings.

Highlights include:

Watch now as the band forms what it wants to find and plays Brown Bear.

It's been a great football season, thanks for paying attention, and join the band back in Providence next semester for the trials and tribulation of hockey season.
