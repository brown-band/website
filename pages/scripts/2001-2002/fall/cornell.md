::script-note[Pregame for this script was the only flat-out rejection we got this season. The replacement was haphazard and dull, so here's the original: (Larry Flint did speak at Cornell, btw.)]

## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that comes in a discrete brown wrapper, it's the Brown University "we read it for the articles" BAND!!!

Yes, it seems that Cornell is having a little bit of trouble with its football team. They're not scoring. Their offense is limp, without energy. They can't complete a pass, find openings, or convert inches into a winning drive. All it all, it doesn't look like the team will be playing on top this season. Watch now as the band flaunts its abilities on the field and plays one of the many things Cornell won't be seeing this season, a "Championship."

Aware of these problems, Cornell brought in outside assistance in the form of noted magazine publisher Larry Flint. While they thought that he would be able to give an inspirational speech and show diagrams to help the team maximize its potential, the team became demoralized when they realized that they would never be able to measure up to expectations. They'll have to settle for the big 0 being solely in front of their record. Watch now as the band shows that it's comfortable with any letter, as long as it's big, and gets "In the Fray."

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that never needs to be airbrushed, it's the Brown University "you want to digitally enhance my what?" BAND!!!

In order to address the pressing need for virility at Cornell, the engineering department has put is current project -- breeding bellhop monkey people -- on hold to create a robotic companion for unsatisfied Aggies. With only a illustrated Indian primer and an erector set, they created an automated masterpiece: Nothing tops "Mr. Roboto"'s copper top. He's fully user-serviceable, only requires a squirt of WD40 for lubrication, and comes with a lifetime subscription of Norton anti-virus updates, just in case. Watch now as the band salutes this metallic hero and forms the box the robot came in.

Once you're through with Mr. Roboto, make sure you take proper care of him. Wipe him down with a soft cloth, and never give him anything in order to have his advice. If you're not careful, and like most Cornell students like to download many potentially illegal files from several anonymous sources, Mr. Roboto may enter safe mode, which we all know is never any fun. Most importantly, always wait at least five minutes for him to cool down before you turn him on again. Watch now as the band forms a rocket to take the secret of Mr. Roboto back to Providence and plays Starblazers.

Of course, as Brown students, we're always willing to share in the experience, though we're naturally suspicious of anything that cannot meditate or survive on vegan brown rice pilaf. Still, the benefits of Mr. Roboto's technology cannot be ignored, especially with the additional protection of a campus-wide firewall. Soon RCs will have nothing to put on their door. Watch now as the band, cashing in its 6 million Chuck-E-Cheese tokens, becomes better, stronger, and more patient and plays "Brown Man Reborn."

:sd[B, BMB]

Be there next week when the Bears defend their families' honor against Penn's Quakers, and the band takes a look at its origins and sees why it turned out this way.
