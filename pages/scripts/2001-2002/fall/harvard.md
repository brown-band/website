::script-note[This is the first trial of a virgin scriptwright. As you may notice, it runs a little long, and was cut both for length and for content (who knew people would be upset by Lawrence Summers references?). It exists here in its original form.]

## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni! Presenting an organization that scores more often than the Red Sox... oh, wait, that's not really an accomplishment, it's the Brown University "NOMAAAA!!!" BAND!!!

Ah, Boston sports. Now that Fenway's finest have slipped to eleventy billion games out of first place, and neither the Patriots nor the Celtics look like they're up to anything this season, it's up to Harvard to give this city a winning sports team. In support of this goal, the Harvard band has increased the size of its bass drum by over 25%, though we believe that it's not the team's _record_ that they're trying to compensate for. Watch now as the band displays its own sports equiptment and plays "Championship."

This pregame show has been brought to you by the letter R and the number 1. Why? Because we're pretty sure that Harvard needs a good supply of both, even though we don't expect any improvements anytime soon. Watch now as the band forms its own favorite letter and plays "In the Fray."

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni! Presenting an organization that can take all comers, it's the Brown University "our president can beat up your president" BAND!!!

Your attention please! Live from the Harvard Staduim in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it's the Ivy League presidents fight of the century! In the Brown corner, hailing from Grapeland Texas, the defending Time Magazine College President of the Year, Ruth "the Civilizer" Simmons! And, in the Crimson corner, from Lower Merion Pennsylvania, former Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence "hey, who forged my signature?" Summers!

Yes, Summers, a man whose name is not even worth the paper it's printed on, is the clear not-favorite in this fight. Even though he is one of the few former Clinton staffers to leave that administration with an unstained reputation, the Brown Band happens to know that he got a failing grade on his last exam in Mr. Liberi's 12th grade AP calculus class. And now he's being entrusted with a University? He'll prove to be no contest for Simmons, known for both her tireless efforts to open institutions of higher education to disadvantaged students and her wicked left hook. Watch now as the band gives a preenactment of this epic, yet ultimately predictable, historical event.

:sd[The band, half in red polos and half in brown blazers, forms two boxing gloves, one red and one brown. At the culmination of the song ("Iron Man"), the brown glove charges the red one, which scatters.]\
_(In hindsight, this was a dumb idea --W)_

No matter the outcome, Harvard is sure to use Lawrence Summers' ability to turn ordinary paper into cold hard cash with a flick of his pen to finance a hostile takeover of downtown Boston. Harvard plans to subjugate all other Boston colleges and eventually move all University buildings and dorms across the river. The Harvard Band will then turn the abandoned city of Cambridge into the only man-made bass drum visible from space. Watch now as the band envisions the wild throngs of John Harvard's teeming masses bringing the walls of Boston a-tumbling down.

:sd[Enblazered bandies form a line across the field, while red bandies form teeming masses (amorphous blob!) nearby. Band plays "Joshua." At the end of the song, the red bandies charge through the line.]

But what of MIT students, who will surely not just lay down their slide rules and X-Files videocassettes in the face of arch-nemesis Harvard? The Brown Band predicts that they will actually escape the oncoming horde and secure themselves in MIT's secret underground shelters, referred to only by the code name "Big Dig." Because of the reproductive stress from the shelters' unbalanced gender ratio, the former MIT students will inevitably evolve into a race of highly intelligent but socially inept Mole People over the course of 1000 years. Emerging from "Big Dig," the Mole People will then execute their ultimate plan for revenge, which is to paint Harvard's Shrine of the Giant Bass Drum to look like R2D2. Watch now as the band, in an unprecidented non sequiter, forms a B on the football field and plays "Brown Cheering Song."

Join the Brown Band next week as the tiny state of Rhode Island is rocked by the battle for the Governor's Cup, and stay tuned for round two of the Harvard vs. Brown boxing grudge match when Harvard's Natalie Portman takes on Brown's Leelee Sobileski.
