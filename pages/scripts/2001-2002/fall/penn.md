::script-note[This script was for parents’ weekend. Thanks go out to all the Bible resources on the web, and King "Elvis" James for his version of said Book.]

## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, parents and guardians, presenting an organization that wasn’t a mistake, it was a surprise, it’s the Brown University "I learned from watching you, Dad!" BAND!!!

The band would like to welcome all of its parents here for Parent’s Weekend. We’re sorry we haven’t called, we’ve just been too busy working on the top floors of the Sciences Library, or studying for our oral exam on vowels for linguistics. Watch now as the band really spends its time watching "Dark Angel" and "Temptation Island" and plays "NFL on Fox."

From Sophocles to Freud, a Brown education is full of knowledge and ideas that we’re sure you’d love to hear about. Of course, all those times you made us watch the Discovery Channel and the primal scene will definitely come in handy during finals. Watch now as the band forms the grades it’s getting this semester and plays "Brown Cheering Song."

:sd[Band forms an "S", plays #2]

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, priests, rabbis, and druids, presenting an organization that’s ready for its closeup, Mr. DeMille, it’s the Brown University "you want me to honor my WHAT?!?" BAND!!!

:sd[Band runs on to the field]

Band, why is this football game different from all other football games?

:sd[Band stops, looks around]

Your parents are here, band, so tuck in your shirt, sit up straight, and just this once, keep it clean.

:sd[Parents run on to the field]

And lo, there passed upon the football field a host of parents. It was proclaimed by the band, let us enact an epic tale, for there is much we know in the Biblical sense. We shall compass Penn tower seven times. The walls shall fall flat and only the harlots will be saved alive. (Joshua, ch. 6)

:sd[Parents are the walls. Some contingent of bandies circles the walls. At the end of the song, the parents fall down.]

For it was that the children of the parents of the band toiled in bondage and the pharoh would not let the band go. Plagues of scrod, Horowitz, locust people, and bikers were visted upon pharoh’s land, but pharoh hardened his heart, neither would he let the band go. Witness as the children of the parents of the band shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea, and ask why did thee build us up, pharoh? (Exodus, ch. 5-14)

:sd[Parents are the red sea. Something about parting and moving, etc.]

The band would like to thank its parents for participating in this show and for convincing us to stay away from safety schools. Watch now as the band doesn’t forget the animists among us and plays "Brown Bear."

:sd[band plays Brown Bear]

Next week, in New Haven.
