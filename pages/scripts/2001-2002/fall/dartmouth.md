::script-note[\*Sniff\* Last home game of the season means poems for the seniors. These are in haiku, which is a beautiful art form so long as it isn’t being broadcast over a PA system.]

## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that doesn’t listen to its elders, it’s the Brown University "You’re not the boss of me!" BAND!!!

The Brown Band is here this afternoon to celebrate its seniors, who, after they graduate, will never ever, not under any circumstances return to band after they graduate. They all disappear and we never see them again. In an effort to keep our seniors just a bit longer, the Brown Band will form every Senior’s dream and play its siren song, "You Can Call Me Al"

:sd[Band forms a 5th year on the field and plays "Al"]

Jonah, Mark, and James\
Carolyn, thanks for staying\
Get on with your lives

There are no words that\
can do justice to seniors\
but we will still try

:sd[Band forms some beverage cup... perhaps a beer stein?]

Jaime with mouse ears\
Wiggy wiggy wiggy cheer\
You’ll always be mom

You left for Sweden\
Mayor Cianci missed you\
Zylgian dancing queen

Way to go there Kim!\
Mikeljohns can show you how\
Math and Classics blend

From Evanston came\
Orchestra tried to claim you\
You are one of us

Greg, which one ate you?\
The Sun Lab, or A D Phi\
Golden tresses flow

Clarinet player\
You date Christina K\
Wild clarinetcest

Aili drew us nude\
We love you crimson hussie\
You went down in flames

Band board voting block\
The Band closet is not chaste\
Monkey’s rear no more

Conductor Alice\
Why are you so drunk today?\
The Jell-o is gone

Leaves fall from the tree\
Changing colors like your hair\
Put that tounge back in

Christine is our mom\
She loves to make us brownies\
Pass the Chee-tos please

Oppressed by the white\
hegemonic paradigm\
I’m so offended

Erwie... just kidding\
Our flutes want to bear your child\
Second stall to left

Meal plan and Keeney\
Who needs a job, please stay here\
We won’t let you leave

Courtney where are you?\
We are sad when you’re not here\
You don’t call or write

Bonsai trumpetess\
How is the weather down there?\
Horn blows all away

The soul of the band\
Won’t be the same without you\
See you all next year

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s still looking for the real criminal, it’s the Brown University "You want to handcuff me to WHAT???" BAND!!!

Stay strong, Brown Bear! Our mascot was escorted from the Yale Bowl under heavy security and wrongly given solitary confinement in New Haven’s stupid building. He has now joined the ranks of other noble visionaries unjustly incarcerated for crimes they didn’t commit, such as Mohatma Ghandi, Henry David Thoreau, and OJ Simpson. The Band will now salute our university’s hero with a symbol of freedom and play "I Want Bruno."

:sd[band forms "S/NC", plays "I Want Candy"]

The story of the Brown Bear is not over here, however. Bruno staged a daring escape from that purgatory that was worthy of MacGuiver himself. The details have been classified by Brown’s athletic department, but it involved daring acrobatics, zen concentration, Bruno’s woodland pals, six raincoats, a three-hundred pound weight, a balance, two tubes of tartar-control toothpaste, the airbag from Ralph Nader’s car, a tube of regular toothpaste, Danny DeVito’s hairpiece, the novelization of "The Emperor’s New Groove," 13th floor SciLi, a year’s supply of Tang, and the key to his cell. Watch now as the Band films it all for Mission Impossible: 3 and plays "Tom Cruise is not nearly as Smooth as Bruno"

:sd[band forms a film reel or something to that effect and plays "Smooth"]

But that’s all last week’s news. Turning to the hot news this week, the village of Hanover has installed its first ever stoplight. In related news, Hanover is anxiously awaiting the arrival of its first ever sheepless carriage. The future keeps looking brighter and brighter for the people, sheep, and sheep-people of our tiny northern neighbor.

:sd[band forms a B and plays "#3"]

No sheep were harmed in the performance of this halftime show. Visit New York next week as the Bears take on SUNY Harlem and the band stays up all night fighting Columbia bandies in the park.
