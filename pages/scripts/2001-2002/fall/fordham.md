::script-note[Techhouse is the new band frat.]

## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that’s been hoping for a renovation of 5th floor Keeney, it’s the Brown University “Home Sweet Closet” BAND!!!

Pembrokers rejoice! It appears that over the summer our favorite ghetto dormitory, Morriss-Champlin, got extensively renovated. Besides the addition of three six-person suites, MoChampers can now look forward to comforts such as magic fingers beds in every room, mirrors on the ceiling, 31 flavors on the RCs’ doors, shag carpeting, and a rooftop field for UK exchange students. Watch now as the band forms its favorite sports equipment other than the cricket wicket and plays the theme to Fox Sports.

The only explanation for such a drastic rags-to-riches change in MoChamp is that a Techhouse project gone awry has opened up a portal to a parallel universe. Other changes are on the horizon, including drum circle nights at Viva, Brown naming George Lincoln Rockwell as its next provost, and the resurrected head of Andrew Mellon becoming president of Sovereign Bank. Watch now as the band forms a “B” for bizzaro and plays Bring the Victory.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that can serve itself but would prefer someone else to, it’s the Brown University “I just ate WHAT?!?” BAND!!!

According to the latest Princeton Review of colleges, Fordham University’s food is ranked third worst in the country. To help out, the Brown Band would like to offer a few culinary tips to our friends from the Bronx: replace the crab juice with coffee milk, stop using Denny’s as your food service provider, get yourselves a truckfull of vegan brown rice pilaf, and avoid any mystery meats ground delivery from Seattle. Watch now as the band forms a knife and fork and plays “Smells Like Curt Cobain.”

The real secret to Fordham’s bad dining has been that all meals were actually made from animals pilfered from the Bronx zoo and deep fried beyond recognition, that is until a band of penguins were able to free themselves from the sinister clutches of Fordham’s highly organized and efficient Sustenance Services, an elite staff of cafeteria workers, with the intent of escaping to Detroit. Their escape was made possible by daring feats of acrobatics and ingenious camoflage. Watch now as the Band forms a disguise no Fordham chef would touch him and plays “Secret Agent Penguin.”

Once free of their imprisonment, the penguins were able to wander the halls of Fordham without incident, because no Fordham student recognized them without the cafeteria’s 11 secret herbs and spices. The penguins were mistaken for such things as:

Watch now as the band mistakes them for it’s own mascot and plays “Brown Bear.”

Join the society of Bruno next week as we host Princeton’s kittens and debate the merits of a joint MCM-Philosophy degree.
