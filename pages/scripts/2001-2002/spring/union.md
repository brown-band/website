Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that isn’t afraid to go down head first, it’s the Brown University "this luge is slippery when wet" BAND!!!

It’s Olympic season again, time for joy, time for tears, and time for Canada to achieve fleeting relevance to the rest of the world. After the warm reception of skeleton to this year’s games, Olympic officials contracted with the Fox network to add even more exciting new sports to the next Winter Olympics. Look for Temptation Pairs Figure Skating, The Chamber luge, Speed Skating away from the stars of When Good Pets Go Bad 3, college liberals ironically watching The O’Reilly Factor (on ice), and Throwing Snowballs at the executive who canceled Family Guy. Watch now as the band waits for the adoption of vegan brown ice pilaf as a sport and forms its current favorite Olympic "Vehicle," the bobsled.

That’s all well and good, but it’s hard to enjoy the Olympics when people are getting mugged at knife point in their very dorm rooms. To combat the rising crime spree, police and security are considering building a BUPS signal on top of the sci-li, posting snipers on grad center, and training Mark Perry to use his latent telekinetic powers. These solutions will of course do nothing against the real cause of crime on campus, demons summoned by the paranormal resonance from the newly-constructed Thomas Watson Center for International Studies. Watch now as the band swallows the bitter pill that the Tee-Watt is the root of all campus evil and plays "Think."

Even though there haven’t been any Crime Reports in the past few days, we’re pretty certain that the Tee-Watt is just being abstinent for Lent. But what can be done to stem the rising tide of Hell that will be coming inside the walls of this building? First and foremost, don’t buy anything from the Hourglass Café, because while it seems that you’re just hurting yourself, that money actually goes straight to the 7th circle to fund the construction of more slanting-out windows. Secondly, wear some sort of full-body protection when you go inside the Tee-Watt to keep you safe from anything lurking in the darkness. Finally, it has been prophesied that the only way to truly subdue the Tee-Watt is to hook it up with sci-li’s 14 stories of power, strength, and virtue. Even though this process will cause activation of Tee-Watt’s fire sprinklers and subsequent uncontrollable flooding, that is the price that must be paid for safety on campus. Watch now as the band, free from the Tee- Watt’s evil clutches, can practice for its entry in the next Winter Olympics, the legendary, unsurpassed, take-that-Scott-Hamilton COUNTERSKATE!!!

Thank you for coming to the Band’s Final Skating Show of the Season. Stop by next semester for football, when the Band will answer the age old question, "which is funnier, a chimpanzee on a trampoline or former president Warren G. Harding?"
