Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Bleeding Hearts: Presenting the only band to ever get cursed at by Dial-a-Prayer, straight from a back alley in Chicago, it’s the Brown University Skating St. Valentine’s Day Massacre.

:sd[Band skates into heart playing “Love Story”]

The band takes a half-hearted approach to heartthrob day as we salute Cupid’s handiwork in creating some of the world’s greatest couples, which include Mr. Ed and Wilbur, Pebbles and Bam-Bam, Giles Threadgold and Joe Reilly, Sonny and Cher, Greg and Cher, and Share and Share Alike. The band would like to take this opportunity to wish all Brown sweethearts a Happy V.D. Day and we hope that Cupid gets you all with his shaft.

:sd[Play “Shaft” and arrow skates through heart]

The band makes its exodus from the ice as we tell you to be back in three weeks to find out why Jackie Mattfeld is moving to Harlem and leaving her house on Humpty Dumpty Street.

:sd[Block up, counter skate off to first measures of “Exodus” and then “Ever True.” First row remains constant and then skates off backwards in front of rest of band]
