Enough of these RAM-ifications, Ladies, and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni and all you sheepish grins, presenting the only band who’s hairdresser doesn’t even know for sure, straight from a quick engagement in the U.R.I. locker room, it’s the Pembroke College bump and grind Band.

:sd[Band runs from trees into block formation, plays a few measures of “Ain’t She Sweet,” cadence into “Our Director’s March,” replete with pinwheels, high stepping and the whole shtick]

The Band would like to acquaint the returning student body with some of the current events the BDJ has been unable to cover due to lack of funds. The dearth of money has resulted in a shortage of such essential items as resident fellows, toilet paper, and junior faculty members. In fact, there seems to be a shortage of just about everything except- Freshmen. With 1,335 in the class of 79—971.5 of whom are Pre-Meds, the Band would like to be the first to misspell the N.Y. Times rumor that the nationwide class of 79 is D-U-M-B but they are “Coming In On A Wing and A Prayer.”

:sd[D M U B- formed during the words misspells the rumor.]

Despite the university’s fiscal floundering, veteran Brunonians have noticed that there’s something fishy going on. Project Build a Better Brown By Bringing Back Beauty to Camp Bruno has included such noticeable achievements as the laying of a new sidewalk of the green, grass in Wriston Quad, the Pembroke sculpture that makes even the new dorms look good, Whitehall is now a garage, and Lloyd’s is now a parking lot. In memory of this, demolished delectable delicatessen the band forms the intersection of Brook and Waterman and plays “Standing On the Corner.”

<u>And this hot flash from the Housing Office</u> – the 145 transfer students who have been living in Arnold Lounge have been reassigned off-campus housing. The Band extends its sympathies to these homeless waifs and plays.

:sd[Repeat “Standing On the Corner.” Run out of previous formation and then run back into on whistle.]

Be back in two weeks to see the real dogs from New Haven Tech.
