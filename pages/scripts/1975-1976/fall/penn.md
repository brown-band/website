Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and Alumni, and all you Milton Bradley dropouts, presenting the phoniest band that funny money can buy, straight from a two-week engagement monopolizing the streets of Atlantic City, New Jersey, it’s the Brown University all-purpose utility band.

:sd[Come running out into two dice]

Philadelphia being the Bicentennial capital, the band pays tribute to a great invention of 1776: Monopoly. To get the show rolling the band throws a three the hard way and promptly moves to Boardwalk. Since we cheat, all we need now is a little bit of luck.

:sd[Play “With a Little Bit of Luck.”]

This is the city, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We were working the day shift out of fraud and bunko. We got a call from the Brown Band. They said that they had landed on Community Chest, but somebody had already grabbed it. Sounded like the work of the Rank Schizzo Gang :sd[Dum-De-Dum-Dum] 2:29 P.M. Suspect was apprehended at the site of his newly erected house. Suspect was convicted and sentenced as following: Go directly to jail, do not pass the buck, do not collect kickbacks.

:sd[Finish playing Dragnet forming jail bars.]

The band passes Go twice, collects $400, and lands on Chance, but since we never take chances we roll again. With our newly acquired wealth we consider investing in the nearest utility. We would buy the Trenton Water Works but we’re not sure that they do. The band forms a big drip on the field and plays Drip Drops Keep Falling on My Head.

:sd[Play Raindrops and form drop coming out of faucet]

Getting board with the game, the band salutes its former athletic director, Andy Geiger. Andy was offered a house on Pennsylvania Avenue and thinking that it was Penn State he accepted. Unable to form a Nittany Lion on the field the Band instead salutes our former athletic director Ferdinand Andy Geiger by forming his initials on the field and playing king Andy’s Song.

:sd[Play “King Herd’s Song” forming F-A-G]

Be back two years from now when the band finds out if Penn is still in the Ivy League.

:sd[Off to “In The Fray”]
