Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and Alumni, and all you freshmen mothers and fathers, and their parents. Presenting the one band only a mother could love, smuggled in especially for today’s performance from lovely, downtown Hohokus, New Jersey. It’s the Brown University Marching Contra-band.

:sd[Run out into a phone]

The band would like to continue its series of lectures on things you should know about Brown entitled, Barely Facts. Ringing in the Centrex system’s first anniversary the band offers instruction on fun things you can do with your phone. Ever try dialing 3-0-3-3?

:sd[Numbers on phone dial out the number, saxes play a busy signal]

Rug out from dialing the housing office for half the day, the band invests a few dollars, get s a touchtone phone. :sd[form touchtone phone] and attempts to buzz President Hornig’s office. :sd[triangles for phone ringing] We’re sorry, but this number is no longer in service. Desperate to hear a human voice at 3 AM the band finds out what it missed for dinner by dialing M-E-N-U.

:sd[Push buttons dial number; recording of Ratty meal.]

In response to this repulsive Ratty repast, the band plays “Classical Gas”.

:sd[Whistle into approx. F.A.G.]

Speaking of loose connections, the band wires the athletic department person to person to Mr. Ferdinand Andy Geiger only to find he’s no longer with us. It seems someone made Andy an offer to come to Pennsylvania and thinking that it was Penn State, he didn’t refuse. With Geiger’s resignation the athletic department decided to cut back from a three letterman to a two letterman by appointing Bob Seiple. The band salutes its new censure and plays shut up the band.

:sd[play “Strike Up the Band” and run into B.S.]

Digressing momentarily from the mainstream of this afternoon’s symposium, the band tacitly turns from initials to officials and takes a primary look at the upcoming nominations for Camp Bruno’s new director by compiling a catalogue of compulsory credentials. He or she must possess:

:::script-list

- A) The economic prowess of Abe Beame
- B) The political tact of Indira Gandhi
- C) The openness and candor of Ron Zeigler
- D) A minimum of four years experience playing football without a helmet, and
- E) The ability to leap the Sci Li in a single bound.

The band salutes our future commandant, forms his office in University Hall, and plays “Beginnings”.

Be back one year from now to see if the Yale band has finally been house broken
