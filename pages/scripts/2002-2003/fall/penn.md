## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni! Presenting an organization that’s cheap, crude, and comes in drums, it’s the Brown University “I learned from watching you, Dad!” BAND!!!

Today both teams are looking for their first Ivy victory, but the Brown Band is confident in the Bears because our parents beat Cornell ten years ago, though we’re unsure about what equipment the chief Axis of Aggie has acquired since then. But given that a good offense is the best defense, especially when it’s dangerously maverick and thoroughly unprovoked, we think we’re in a good position to uphold the family name and achieve regime “Championship.”

Cornell, for its part, has been trying to avoid this game at all costs, going so far as to pull out of Quatar, where it has been occupying a medical school, and releasing all its captive livestock from their pens. But not even the recent revelation that Johnson and Wales University has secretly developed its own football program will keep the Bears from taking the field. The Brown Band, which always prefers forming B on the field to trading its life for fossil fuels on foreign soil, will welcome today’s relatively peaceful impending conflict with...

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, moms, dads, and increasingly pressured younger siblings, presenting an organization that’s ready to teach its parents well, it’s the Brown University “feed you on my WHAT???” BAND!!!

It’s Parents’ Weekend again, when our parents take time off from following the Korn and Disturbed tour around the country, stop renting out our old rooms to railway hobos who creepily resemble us, and join us here on College Hill for a weekend of shared college experiences. Why, they haven’t been here 24 hours and already they’ve held a toga sock-hop, constructed Pong on the SciLi, and bought the first three Belle and Sebastian albums. But why shouldn’t they be comfortable here? The way things are today a draft card is all that separates us from 1964 anyway. So, with that in mind, the band, and its parents, will remember the long-haired glory days of past and present and play...

Parents’ Weekend is also a time to show our parents where their hard-earned tuition money has been going. While in years past it’s been used for everything from endowment-building at Newport Grand Jai Alai to helping empty out dead Nigerian dictators’ bank accounts, this year the corporation has picked much more sensible goals: fuzzy dice in every shuttle, a Roman citizen on every green, and a Nerf bow and arrow set for every BUP. The band is especially excited about the new monthly schedule for flushing dirt and grime from campus facilities. Always happy to get the blood flowing, the band will clean out the new Thomas Watson International Studies building to the tune of...

Active little self-important creatures that we are, Brown students have been starting hundreds of new organizations that are eager to put together informational programs for parents. Today look for presentations by the Boston Celtics Society, The Samurai Anti-Defamation League, Brown ROTC, The Brown Young Know-Nothings, Brown Yatzee, Club Field Tennis, and Okay, Maybe One Or Two Victims Somewhere, Just As Long As It’s One Of Those Former Soviet Union Countries Whose Name I Can’t Pronounce Anyway. But remembering that there’s no replacement for the Brown Band, the Band will make a B for itself and its parents and play...

Next week the Brown Band, armed with bagels and a hankering for wholesome breakfasts, will take to the streets of Philadelphia and demand lower cholesterol and those nifty wide-brimmed hats.
