## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that wants to elect Spike for Governor, it's the Brown University "I accept your engorging hot-dog challenge" BAND!!!

The grim blade of term limits has descended on Rhode Island governor Lincoln Almond, finally ending URI's vice-like grip on state politics. Almond says he looks forward to retirement, which he will use to spend time with his family, polish his tusks, and eat Providence. The Band, divided between its school loyalty for Republican Don Carcieri and its social conscience for Democrat Myrth "This Time For Sure" York, will remember that we're not even registered to vote here anyway and play ...

But we rejoice because the favored candidate for the real capo de tuti capi of Rhode Island, the Providence mayor, is Brown's own David Cicilline, a man personally diverse enough to appeal to everyone except Providence's significant Inuit vote. If Cicilline is elected, we'll look forward to city council meetings out on the green during sunny days, the de-armament of the Providence Police, and drum circles, drum circles, drum circles. The Band welcomes this bright future with ...

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that's not afraid to construct distractions on the side of major highways, it's the "Nibbles WHAT??? Away" Big Blue Bug Band!

Recent surveys of Rhode Island residents have shown that termites, even colossal cerulean ones, simply aren't being perceived as terrifying pests anymore. Other vermin, like the silverfish, the Egyptian mosquito, the syphilitic plague-ridden monkey, the rust-proof mongoose, Cranston, the ewok, or the lesser-horned ram are instilling more fear than the common termite ever has. New England Pest Control is going so far as to consider replacing its iconic mascot with a more despicable pest, a 9 foot tall Joe Mollicone.

As the self-appointed big blue keepers of the big blue faith, the Big Blue Bug Band has vowed to raise awareness of the big blue danger posed by big blue bugs and ensure their position as the premier big blue symbol of peskiness in this little blue state. Big blue bugs will blot out the sun! Big blue bugs will destroy Rhode Island's maranara sauce reserves! Big blue bugs will close the University Club until we get our way! The Big Blue Bug Band will now eat the forest for the wood and play ...

Still, Brown students at heart, we're hoping for a resolution born of peaceful demonstrations, colloquiums, and sparsely-attended community discussions. Because, in the end, isn't there a little big blue bug in all of us? Actually, there will be, because today we're announcing a program of implanting big blue bug larva in suitable hosts across the state, starting with the Governor's Cup and moving on to his chin. Capping off its most alliterative show yet, the Big Blue Bug Band will form a B and play ...

Next week the Bears will battle more Rams at Fordham, but the band, self-important little creatures that we are, will wisely stay home.
