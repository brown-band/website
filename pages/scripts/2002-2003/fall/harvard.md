## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has the freedom to get an Sc.B. in puppies and flowers, it's the Brown University "We're putting the 'S' back in S/NC" BAND!!!

The reputation of Harvard University, one of the finest educational institutions in Muskatine county, Iowa, was besmirched last year by accusations of rampant grade inflation. In a controversial move, Harvard responded by replacing beloved Assistant Provost Henry Winkler with the world's foremost authority on corrective alphabetics, Texas Instruments' Speak and Spell. The Brown Band salutes the heroes who, despite all odds, have struggled to bring down Harvard's overall GPA with the theme to NFL on Fox.

Harvard students, who characteristically never think about their college's reputation, are now trying anything to keep their academic performance well beneath their professors' already low expectations. Students have been seen vigorously quaffing brain-cell killing beverages such Charles River Water Classic, Diet Charles River Water (same great bacteria, just one calorie), Vanilla Charles River Water, and Pepsi Blue. The Brown Band, ever the clairvoyant, will predict Harvard students' future grades to the tune of Brown Cheering Song.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization whose sandals have been sticking to the floors of the showers in Keeney, it's the Brown University "my drain is clogged with WHAT???" BAND!!!

The Brown Band welcomes the class of 2006, and it is always a joy for us to see wide-eyed freshman discover the marvels of college life — such as a cappella arch sings or Ratty breakfasts — that we've long since stopped caring about. Why, they're so cute and innocent, whether packed together in the lounges on Wriston or sleeping over with their unit at health services afterwards, that we just want to boil them water and bake them brownies. Watch now as everyone is out to get the band and we resolve to find the weasel who snagged our Doritos.

One thing you can say about this year's freshman class is that they sure do love stairs. Why, all day long they just go down like an alternative energy activist protesting elevators. Still, if they spend all their time on the stairs and not at the Rock, their grades will go down like an alternator dropped from the roof of a building, an event that, in history, will surely go down like an altercation between a samurai and a convenience store clerk. Watch now as the band clears its throat and stands up to play "Speak Up Mambo."

A surprising trend has freshman forgoing traditional UFS employment for more esoteric means of making money. From TAing grad seminars in engineering socioneurotics to selling fake IDs to the Savage Patch kids, why, there's no end to their fiscal ingenuity. Image-conscious Thayer St. bikers have even been hiring freshman as runners to buy the falafel wraps, Beck albums, and loose fit hipster khakis that they're too afraid to purchase in person. The Brown Band, however, is hoping that, with a B and a Brown song for our beloved alumni, we'll all see a secure future in Providence's next political machine.

Directly following today's game the Band will host a pole-removal clinic for Harvard students, and next week we'll be at URI as the Bears fight the Rams for our Governor's favor.
