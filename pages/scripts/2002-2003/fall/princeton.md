## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni! Presenting an organization that will live to see another sunrise, it's the Brown University "Forrester? I hardly know her" BAND!!!

Not to be outdone by rival small state Rhode Island's alleged mayoral corruption, New Jersey has cooked up a political scandal of its own as Democrats replaced ethically quirky Senate candidate Robert Torricelli with aging hipster Frank Lautenberg. As Brown students, we stand in solidarity with the state Supreme Court's decision that deadlines don't mean anything anyhow, and we're overjoyed to see a Supreme Court that doesn't throw an election to an ignorant, unqualified smirk. The Brown Band will now form an object leathery as Lautenberg's skin and play "NFL on Fox"

Republican challenger Doug Forrester, meanwhile, is faced with having to reprint thousands of signs and leaflets bearing his "Doug Forrester is not Robert Torricelli" campaign slogan. Speculations about his new slogan have been running wild: "Vote Forrester, Because Frank Lautenberg Is Just Robert Torricelli In An Old Guy Mask," or "Doug Forrester: He Can Cut Medicare Because He Doesn't Need It." The Band is confident that, if elected, Doug Forrester will be able to do for New Jersey what the Boss did for Asbury Park. With a B for Bruuuuuuuce, the we'll play "Brown Cheering Song"

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and freakishly plaid little creatures, presenting an organization that's waiting for its Nobel Prize in Puppies and Flowers, it's the Brown University "Sweeden? I hardly... no wait that doesn't really work" BAND!!!

The Brown Band congratulates Princeton professor Daniel Kahneman for his recent Nobel Prize in Economics. Kahneman's groundbreaking insight was that humans are not rational, calculating, or self-interested in their economic dealings, but instead brutish, indiscriminate, and, on occasion, ugly. His theories will go far in explaining public acceptance of such perverse economic spectacles as instant-win lottery games, energy futures, and the privatization of social security. The band will search out the prime motivator in economics and play "Karn Evil 9."

:sd[band forms magnifying glass]

Having all taken Intro to Psych our freshman years (pass/fail, of course), the Brown Band is well versed in the psychology that Kahneman was able to apply to economics, even if we spent most of the time trying to flatten squirrels with our copies of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. But we still know all about the human behaviors Kahneman studied, such as the playing of sports without clothes, the needing to know what students who applied to Princeton were also accepted by Seton Hall, and the constant oppression of the underclass. Content to just imitate University buildings, the band will give a nod to the best thing to come out of New Jersey since Brown, and play "Born To Run."

This great nation seems to be barreling into a recession, and Princeton students are being hit the hardest of any. Besides eliminating all remaining left hand turns in the town, what else can Princeton cut from its budget to maintain its already frugal standard of living? How about:

:::script-list

- A) Kevin Mitnick
- B) Eating clubs' weekly eating out sessions
- C) Reparations
- D) Subsidies for orange-colored restaurants specializing in chicken wings and tight clothing
- E) Professors stolen from other Ivy League universities
- F) The Princeton Band

Watch as the combined might of the Brown Band chooses an answer and plays "Brown Man Born"

We'll be back in Providence next week battling Cornell and wishing our dorm rooms came with mints on the pillows.
