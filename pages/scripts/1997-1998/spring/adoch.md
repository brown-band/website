Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni- and prefrosh- presenting an organization that is the best class in the history of Brown University, it’s the Brown University “Good things come to those who wait-list” Band!

:sd[Band applies itself to the stage in Meehan]

In this show, the Band would like to salute...er, we mean...completely ridicule the college admissions process. For this purpose, our two brave show writers went to the admissions office and said, “Excuse me. We want to make fun of you. Can we have an application?” They told us they had run out, and to try back next September. After being so quickly deferred by the admissions office, we set out in search of an application, visiting 10 colleges in three days. We were unable to find an application anywhere, so we decided to write our own and send it into Brown. We even filled out part of it! Watch now as the Band plays “Brown Application.”

- 3\. Go directly to number 5. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.
- 5\. If God had a name, what would it be and would you call it to His face, if you were faced with Him in all His glory, what would you ask if you had just one question?
- 6\. Why ask why?

Finally, read an essay in your own handwriting.

**The activities I was involved in in High School taught me a lot about leadership. I was very active in serving my community, and I think that community service is an important part of who we are as citizens. I think that... never mind what I think! What do you think? You only take 17% of your applicants? What’s up with that? And what’s up with pencils? I mean, nobody uses those, right? Don’t you love the paternalism of Windows 95? Pope me some Guam! :sd[serious, earnest voice] And in conclusion, I think Brown would be the best place for me to develop my talents and become a future citizen of the world.**

Well, that’s it. You’re done! You can relax; all the heart-wrenching struggle of the application process is over. (ominously) Until you start applying for a job. Watch now as the Band looks ahead to the future by playing “Time Warp.”
