Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization with an ego problem AND an id problem, it’s the Brown University “Freud where prohibited” Band!

Recently, the Band has begun to psychoanalyze itself, as we are quite disturbed by the fact that every time the percussion section plays the bells, we start to salivate. We decided that the best way to solve the problem would be to analyze this show. Close scrutiny revealed bad psychology puns and many talented :sd[thick accent, emphasis] Jung musicians, but no Sexuality and Society concentrators. We must be repressed. Watch now as the band salutes the science of psychology by forming a Rorschach inkblot test and playing “Johnny’s Superego.”

For this week’s show, we want to talk about the Big Red Rock. It’s far from civilization, it’s cold, it’s deserted, and it has a really big gorge. The Brown Band wants to dedicate this portion of the show to :sd[pause] Mars. We find it remarkable that Mars bears such a resemblance to a certain obscure school in upstate New York. In fact, the biggest scientific controversy that has come to light in recent months is the question :sd[dramatic voice]: Is there life on Cornell? The late astronomer Carl Sagan said, “yes, I think so...” :sd[businesslike, scientific TV program narrator tone] The Brown Band had doubted this conclusion, and decided to challenge the hypothesis. In conjunction with Brown’s world-renowned Planetary Geology Department, we launched a mission to Cornell, equipped with a ‘Red Rover,’ designed to bring us a sample right over. In short, sample analysis found the Cornell rock teeming with “billions and billions” of students. The only question that remains it whether or not Big Red harbors intelligent life. Watch now as the Band forms a big red planet and plays “Starblazers.”

Speaking of stars, some of the world’s finest athletes gathered recently in Nagano, Japan for the 18th Winter Olympics. :sd[smooth announcer voice] Our coverage is brought to you by the Brown Band Broadcasting Corporation. Our guarantee, something no other network can claim: we promise to bring you at least 5 minutes of actual Olympic events EVERY HOUR!! Our exciting Olympic coverage will begin with a sport newly added to the Olympic Games: curling! In fact, we hear that soon to follow will be crimping, manicures, and... What? Ohhhh! Never mind. Anyway, another first in the Olympic lineup is women’s ice hockey, with Brown’s Tara Mounsey and Katie King on the gold-medal winning US team. And in yet another first-time sport, Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati, whose gold medal had been revoked when he tested positive for marijuana use, had it restored when it was realized that marijuana is not a performance-ENHANCING substance. And we would like to propose a new event for the next winter games: synchronized ice banding.

:sd[Inane announcer voice] Watch now as the Brown Band performs their extremely difficult skating program by forming One-Olympic-Ring playing “Bring the Victory,” the same song that won them the gold medal in their last skating show. Now, this band has overcome many obstacles to be here today. The entire trombone section was raised by wolves, and the president of the band had his car towed away earlier this year, but he’s made an incredible comeback since, and oh, no! it looks like the bass drummer is having major balance problems; let’s hope he can make it into formation, and they’re skating, skating, skating, skating, the band is skating around and around :sd[variation: if we are in formation by this point, then say that we are standing, standing, standing…]…and yes! it looks like they’re going to play a song!

Join us next week when Brown Hockey takes on Clarkson Golden Knights, and the Band wins another golden medal.
