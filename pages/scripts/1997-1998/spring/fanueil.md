Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting the organization that trashed the U.S. Men’s Hockey Team’s hotel room, it’s the Brown University "Really, it was us. For real. Really!" Band!!

The Brown Band is a student-run musical organization that supports Brown athletic teams. In addition to being Brown’s athletic supporter, we play scripted halftime shows for football games, and we are the only skating band in the world. Every year, we perform two to three shows on the ice after hockey games. This show will be a sample of the Band’s musical and creative talent. Our first song will be "For Bruno and For Brown."

:sd[Band plays "For Bruno and For Brown"]

In our shows, we generally parody many different things. For this show, we wanted to make fun of staplers. Particularly maroon ones. But, we realized that the National Association for the Preservation of Staplers (NAPS) might be offended. So we decided to make fun of religion instead. Boy, isn’t religion funny? Ha ha ha....:sd[Scriptreader dies dramatically, new scriptreader takes over.] Watch now as the Band salutes infinite cosmic power by playing "Starblazers."

:sd[Band plays "Starblazers"]

Aaarrrggghhhh, matees, ye be seein’ a good show heeerrre, but can ye find me burried treasurr? Heere be directions to me treasurr. Take I-95 North for three million seven hundred 29 thousand paces, then take ye a left for fifteen thousan’ four hundre’ an’ two paces, then take ye a right a’ the 7-11, an’ it will be in the chest behin the garbage cans. And ye’ can have me bottle o’ rum, too. Yo ho ho. Next, me matees from the Brown Band will play "Russian Sailors Dance."

:sd[Band plays "Russian Sailors Dance."]

Speaking of Russian.... These two guys walk into a bar, and one of them is carrying an octopus. He orders a beer and sets the octopus down on the bar. So, he’s having his drink, and the bartender comes up to him and says ‘Excuse me, I can’t help but notice you have an octopus there. Why is that?’ Just then, the octopus stands up and :sd[scriptreader lapses into Russian for a few sentences], and that’s how they get the jelly in jelly donuts. And this is how the Band sounds when they play "Brown Cheering Song."

:sd[Band plays "Brown Cheering Song."]

The Band recently had a marshmallow roast. Unfortunately, we ran out of regular marshmallows and were forced to break open a limited edition box of Lucky Charms that the Princeton Band sold us for sixty-nine cents. But after seeing the marshmallows, we discovered just WHY the edition was so limited: Black anvils! Red hammer-and-sickles! Green beans! And white teeth, to remind your child to visit the dentist IMMEDIATELY after eating the cereal! :sd[Short pause.] Our next song will be "Joshua."

:sd[Band plays "Joshua"]

:sd[Didactic, dry tone.] Now, before we continue any further with our show, I’d like to pause so I can make a short discourse on the importance of revolution as a driving force of social and cultural history. I will be focusing on the case studies of 1789 France and 1917 Russia, though not the case of the United States, as the popularly termed "American Revolution" is something of a misnomer. Revolution involves an overthrow of an existing social order, following the discontent of a critical mass of people, who then are compelled to activism...:sd[during this time, the Band has begun to eye the scriptreader in a rather annoyed way, until he is approached from behind, suffocated with a trench coat, and disposed of. New scriptreader takes over]. Watch now as the Band celebrates its revolutionary power by playing "In the Fray".

:sd[Band plays "In the Fray"]

The Brown Band has recently become interested in the study of language, and we did good on our last grammar test, and we learned to not split infinitives, and we know what part of the sentence to put our prepositions in, and we learned not to write really long run-on sentences. But English isn’t the only language we’ve been studying rigorously. In fact, we’re currently in training for the Hindi 500. And hey! We’re not just proficient in human languages--we can speak animal languages, too! To quote a well-known bear in his native language: "Only you can prevent forest fires." Watch now as the Band plays "Brown Bear."

:sd[Band plays "Brown Bear."]

Now one thing the Brown Band occasionally does Is writing in verse, but only because Our humorous tendencies tend to erode :sd[short pause] Not to mention, our President’s car was just towed.

We write about politics, inkblots, and aliens, We’re wordy, verbose, and sesquipedalian. And sometimes our scripts will include a surprise- At the end of this segment, the narrator dies.

:sd[Scriptreader looks up, confused. Has a knowing pissed-off-Kyle look on his face. Is then hit over the head with a bass drum mallet. Dies unremarkably. New scriptreader takes over.]

Segue to haiku: Warped humor is essential. The Band plays "Time Warp."

:sd[Band plays "Time Warp"]

And now, a final question for our audience to ponder: what is the sound of one band clapping? :sd[Band applauds] We hope you enjoyed the show, and join us tonight at 7:00, as the Brown basketball team takes on Harvard, and the Band takes on the Harvard bass drum.
