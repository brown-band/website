Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that gets knocked down, but gets up again, it’s the Brown University “flirting with… disaster” Band!

:sd[Band skates onto ice, and Kyle barely averts disaster]

This show will be a salute to disasters. We promise, however, not to say anything about Bill Clinton’s latest disaster, the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.

But speaking of things with a high price tag, the Brown Band recently saw James Cameron’s new movie “Titanic”. We understand that producing “Titanic” was almost as expensive as a Brown education. However, the film recovered all of its costs within a few weeks. We can only hope the same for ourselves. For those of you that haven’t yet seen the movie, the Brown Band wants to apologize for revealing the ending in this week’s show. You may want to cover your ears while we read the next line.

:sd[Pause]

:sd[Deeper voice] The boat sinks.

The Band will now reenact the story of the Titanic taking its maiden :sd[pause] voyage, from Liverpool to New York.

:sd[Band forms Titanic]

Look out, Band! Ice!

:sd[Band looks down [exaggeratedly] and screams in terror.]

Hold on to your lifeboats, everyone, and watch now as the Band plays on.

A little-known fact of history is that the Titanic was an engineering design project of RPI students. In fact, the Titanic’s original destination was not New York, New York, but Troy, New York, home of Rensselaer. Plans were changed when it was realized that THIS Troy didn’t have a harbor. However, we still enjoyed watching the Brown hockey team sack the Trojans. On this, the hundredth anniversary season of Brown hockey, we’d like to salute the spirit of good sportsmanship by forming our opponent’s initials and playing “Brown Bear”.

Another great disaster of recent weeks was <u>Vanity Fair</u>’s grossly inaccurate portrayal of Brown. We all know that Brown students actually drive Jaguars, not Porsches, and take weekend trips to Venice, not Paris. And the article completely neglected the Brown Band, who recently returned from a world tour with Brown alums Duncan Sheik and Lisa Loeb.

:sd[pause]

They opened for us. We toured New York and Tokyo. We didn’t go to Paris, of course; it’s just so blasé now.

But, there’s no need to be defensive about <u>Vanity Fair</u>’s portrayal of Brown. We’ll just let the article speak for itself. In the words of Jennet Conant, “What’s behind the explosion of BMWs and Chanel jackets on its once quiet campus?” :sd[pause] Watch now as the Brown Band forms an exploding BMW and plays “Fire.”

:sd[Band forms BMW, explodes, and plays “Fire.”]

Well, it’s time for us to leave now. If we stay any longer, we’ll probably get a parking ticket. Join us February 20 as Brown takes on Cornell Big Red Disasters, and the Band offers emergency musical assistance. Watch now as the Band forms all that’s left of the BMW and plays “Ever True to Brown.”

:sd[Band does just that, and skates away playing “Ever True”]
