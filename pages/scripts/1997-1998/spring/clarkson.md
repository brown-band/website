Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that French cuffs its Cavariccis, it's the Brown University "2 Legit to Quit" Band!!!

:sd[Band hammers its way onto the ice]

First was 70s nostalgia was chic, then 80s nostalgia was where it's at, but recent events in the Persian Gulf have made the Band nostalgic for the early 90s. They were the good old days...the good old days of the Bush administration. The Berlin Wall fell, televangelist Jimmy Swaggart fell twice, and the Buffalo Bills fell four times. And oh, how innocent and carefree we were! We all drank our Crystal Pepsi, as we dreamed of the soulful voices of the New Kids on the Block. We also looked up to Milli Vanilli, but we didn't want to be like them. We wanted to be musicians. In our quest to relive those happy times, we've been scouring the thrift shops in search of Reebok Pumps and Hypercolor T-shirts for that retro look.

Watch now as the band goes retro by forming a slap bracelet and playing "Smells Like Teen Spirit."

Attention, Brown fans! Are YOU sitting in the hot seat? If you are, then GET UP! before you get burned.

:sd[Pause]

Last year, the Band traveled to Clarkson for a hockey game. The Band was deeply offended by the rudeness of the Clarkson fans- where did they learn such behavior, from sheep? We had wanted to take revenge by verbally abusing Clarskon in this week's show. But then we realized that we didn't KNOW anything about Clarkson. It's so gosh darn obscure! So instead, we decided to pay tribute to obscurity. We can name all our B vitamins- can you? Did you know that the last Whig president of the US was Millard Fillmore? And we're also world travelers: we've been to such exotic places as Ouagadougou and Djibouti! But the Band's favorite road trip was to the nation of Andorra, tucked away in the picturesque Pyrennes between France and Spain. We returned with a lovely photograph of the beautiful Andorran landscape. All of it. Watch now as the Band salutes obscurity by forming Andorra and playing "Kodachrome."

The Band recently completed its applications for the housing lottery and for BTV's new show, The Dating Zone. But due to an unfortunate paperwork mix-up, we found ourselves in a dating lottery :sd[pause], with the following segments:

:::script-list

- Segment I- Good Dates. :sd[Pause.] These are probably already taken.
- Segment II- Special Interest Dates: ISO members, computer science concentrators, and Brown Band show writers.
- Segment III- Sam Blackman.
- Segment IV- Your RC
- Segment V- singles, doubles, and triples
- Segment F- the Princeton Band

:::

If you find yourself in Segment F, do not despair. There are still plenty of good dates to be had, if you just do your research.

:sd[Pause.]

As for the location of your date, may we suggest 18 and over night at the Underground. We hear that it's very quiet and romantic. Watch now as the Band plays "In the Fray" while presenting its entry in the lottery multimedia contest: a daring, death-defying, date-winning B!

We hope you enjoyed our shows for this year's hockey season. Be sure to join us next year as the Brown Band takes on the football team.
