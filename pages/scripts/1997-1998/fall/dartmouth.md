> _Interesting weekend we just survived (and we did JUST survive)... The Dartmouth Athletic Department wouldn't let either band onto the field, so all shows were performed in the stands as best as could be managed, the visiting stands were closed down due to the snow, so the Band and all the Brown fans had to sit in the home stands mere inches from rabid Dartmouth fans, the Brown Bear got pelted with snowballs, the Band was also snowballed and even taunted by eight-year-olds._

> _The Dartmouth script, running counter to form, was actually witty (as written by our own Craig Wenzel's older brother) but true to form included a lame top-ten list. I'd been considering including a "Top Ten Reasons We Don't Do Top Ten Lists" (#1 being: We don't want to be mistaken for the DCMB) in our show this year but didn't because top ten lists are a crime against nature unless Letterman does them himself._

## Pregame:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that blasphemes with impunity, it's the Brown University Manichean Heresy BAND!

:sd[Band sanctifies field]

:sd[Band forms the all-seeing eye of God and plays some song about football or another]

Last week's once-millenial elections for supreme being of the Western-paradigm cosmos were once again clinched in a landslide by Jehovah, God of Abraham. His only opponent, a shoebox salesman from Kalamazoo, Michigan named Chuck Demiurge was running on a platform of milk and honey in every pot and a locust in every garage. He was making a good show in the polls. However, on election day all his supporters mysteriously slept in. Said Demiurge, "I really didn't foresee all the obstacles involved in running against an omnipotent incumbent."

## Halftime:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has just had its conviction reduced to involuntary manslaughter, it's the Brown University "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" BAND!

:sd[Band shakes, rattles, and slams onto field]

We're baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!

Oh wait, sorry. It has recently been brought to our attention that you people resent all the sheep jokes. Maybe it hits a little too close to home . . . perfectly understandable. I mean, we can make sheep jokes till the cows come home @for example, did you hear the one about the Dartmouth student with insomnia? He had a visual aid!@ but we certainly aren't limited to that. There are plenty of other things we can make fun of you for. OK, what's been going on on campus recently? Nothing? Then what do you do with your time? We know you don't bother studying. Oh, that's right!

:sd[Band forms beer bottle and plays "Everybody Needs Somebody..."]

{Of course, we really shouldn't make too much fun of Dartmouth, I mean, just look at all the great stuff it's given us:

BASIC, @Dinesh D'Souza,@ :sd[Beat], :sd[Beat]

Hmm, actually there really isn't all that much, is there?

Watch now as the Band salutes everything Dartmouth has done for Western Culture.

:sd[Band forms a null set and plays #2]}

{Speaking of Western Culture,} On the political front, we in America have recently been graced and blessed with the presence of a visiting dictat- er, dignitary from China. Watch now as the Band salutes the historic occasion of Jiang in America by playing an excerpt from Nixon in China.

:sd[Band plays a (pentatonic) scale over and over and over and over and over... ]

Oh no! They've gotten stuck. We need something to jar them out of it. Hey Band, imagine four years in Hanover!

:sd[Band plays jarringly dissonant chord (concert F's and B naturals)]

Sorry about that, Band. At least I didn't make you imagine paying for it!

:sd[Band screams in terror]

Our agent says we should play what our audience wants to hear. Unfortunately we don't have any arrangements of Dave Matthews Band or any other soulless whiteboy funk. You'll have to deal with real soul for now.

:sd[Band forms a "B" and plays "Hold On I'm Coming"]

Join us next week back in civilization when we can stop screaming in the wilderness and start screaming at the urban lions of Columbia. For now, sit tight for the malodorous marching of the DU- I mean the DCMB.

:sd[Band marches off to #1]
