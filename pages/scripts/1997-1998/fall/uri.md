## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that secretly funded Ralph Nader's election campaign, it's the Brown University "soft money, hard luck" BAND!

:sd[Band charges field from sidelines]

:sd[Band forms Marv Albert's left kidney and plays (What else?) "Championship"]

:sd[Band forms a "B" and plays "Brown Cheering Song"]

:sd[Band chills out for a bit while the teams are introduced and the coin gets flipped]

:sd[Band plays SSB on cue]

## Halftime

:sd[Brown Band conglomerates in southernmost endzone, URI Band blocks up in opposite endzone]

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization [beat] and a disorganization, it's the Brown University and University of Rhode Island Bands!

:sd[Bands run to edge of field]

Sit back and enjoy their Dueling Band Shows.

:sd[Brown Band plays "Dueling Banjos" intro and runs to 15 yard line]

:sd[URI Band responds and runs to 15 yard line]

Two bands walk into a bar. The third one ducks.

:sd[Brown Band plays and runs to 30 yard line]

:sd[URI Band responds and advances]

What if this weren't a hypothetical question?

:sd[Brown Band plays intro again and runs to 45 yard line]

:sd[URI Band does the same]

You know, guns don't kill people. It's those darn bullets.

:sd[One last time through the intro-- play and response...]

We might not be done, but we sure are finished.

:sd[Bands form a big huge banjo on the field, play "tutti" section]

Wait, that sounded a little off, you might want to tune your G string.

:sd[Bands play a G, bend it down and up]

That's much better. We should have that banjo tuned by mid-February.

:sd[URI Band marches upfield, Brown Band scatters]

OK, A priest a rabbi and an President-elect Gee. . . oh never mind, you've probably heard that one before. Watch now as the Brown University Band, lead by our Student Conductor Kate Brucher, plays "For Bruno and For Brown."

:sd[Band forms a "B" and plays "For Bruno and For Brown"]

:sd[Brown Band scatters off field, URI Band performs "Tuesday Afternoon." They have their own script.]

:sd[URI Band ends in concert arch facing Brown stands, Brown Band joins formation]

And now, ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, their feud settled, the bands join forces to battle the audience. Watch now as the combined might of the Brown University and University of Rhode Island Bands pummel you with "Johnny's Mambo" conducted by Brown University Director of Bands Matt McGarrell, with trumpet solo by URI Band Director Don Smith.

:sd[Bands do just that]

Join us next week when Brown takes on Penn State. For now, the bands take leave of you. Of course, we all know which is the best band, but just to prove it they'll be the one marching off the field playing their fight song.

:sd[URI Band about faces, percussion sections roll off, and both bands march in opposite directions playing their respective fight songs]
