## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and Princeton first-years, presenting an organization that has switched to a flat-fee unlimited band access, it’s the Brown University “You’ve Got Mail!” BAND!

:sd[Band charges in from sidelines, slows suddenly to a crawl]

We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties. Please stand by while we install more bandwidth.

:sd[Band forms a football, plays “Championship”]

Watch now as the band proudly salutes the battle between New York and New Jersey for Ellis Island, Marv Albert taking a bite out of [beat] crime, the joy of actually having a home stadium, the joy of living in the Grad Center (glug, glug), barbecued beanie babies, the kitchen sink, Marvel Comics’ new superhero, Jersey Girl, and Catherine the Great and the horse she rode in on (and vice versa) by forming the SINGLE, NON-ROTATING “B!”

:sd[Band forms plain ol’ “B” and plays “In the Phray”]

The Brown Band was quite saddened to learn that the recent negotiations to bring the New England Patriots to Providence fell through. This will surely put a dent in plans for urban renewal because, frankly, what downtown Providence really needs is more traffic jams. We understand that, even though it’s not really in New England, the Patriots were also considering moving to Princeton. That fell through when it was realized that Princeton didn’t have a stadium.

Watch now as the band forms all that’s left of Palmer Stadium - polaroids - and plays “Kodachrome.”

White House documents recently unearthed by the special prosecutor express growing worry that America is being left behind in the pop-diva-secret-agent department-- in short, a Spice Girls gap. The documents go on to propose the formation of the American Spice Girls:

- Jersey Spice,
- Bike Cop Spice,
- Walt Whitman Spice,
- A Capella Spice,\
   and :sd[beat]
- Oregano.

These documents were unsigned but for some mysterious reason were all printed on “From the Desk of the Arkansas Governor” stationery. The documents initially propose that the first American Spice concert take place in Princeton, but that fell through when it was realized that Princeton didn’t have a stadium.

Watch now as the band salutes its favorite spice and plays “Salt Forevermore.”

:sd[Band forms salt shaker and plays “Brown Forevermore”]

And now the band salutes a Princeton institution, the Educational Testing Service: a for-profit non-profit organization dedicated to the proposition that if somebody finds a way to cheat on one of their tests, it’s not their problem. The band managed to get a hold of one of the infamous cheat sheets, here’s a sample question:

Now that Fred, the Dunkin’ Donuts donut guy, has retired, what is his new slogan?

:::script-list

- A) Time to clip my toenails
- B) Donuts? We don’t NEED no steenkeeng donuts!
- C) Acting president? Sorry Provost Pomerantz, you’ll have to do that yourself. I’m retired.
- D) Time to cheat on a standardized test
- E) NOT THICK ENOUGH!!!\
   or
- F) The Princeton Band

:::

No, it’s not “F.” Oh, Fred planned on joining the Princeton Band, but that fell through when he realized that Princeton didn’t have a stadium. Watch now as the band forms the correct answer and salutes the donut man by playing “Hot Stuff.”

Join us next week when the Bears slam the Rams and we try to get the URI band to lighten up a little bit.
