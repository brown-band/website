## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, freshman mothers and fathers (and their parents), presenting an organization that now has a corner on the world beef jerky market, it’s the Brown University "Please pass the parbroiled percussionist" BAND!

:sd[Band runs onto field, forms an oblong kidney stone and plays (take a wild guess...) "Championship"]

The band has been considering a change in its dietary habits-- cannibalism. According to our resident bioculinary expert, the most tender meat comes from long distance runners. The only problem is catching ‘em! Watch now as the Band devours its young.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, freshman mothers and fathers (and their parents), presenting an organization that dressed as El Niï¿½o for Hallowe’en, it’s the Brown University "All I got was a rock" BAND!

:sd[Band spooks field]

And as long as we’re on the subject of rocks (bear with me, this does get back to rocks), boy are we glad the Cornell game is at home this year. It would’ve been a real pain to hitch a ride on the Pathfinder to get to ol’ Big Red. What I want to know is, is NASA jockeying for sponsors in the automotive industry or something? Pathfinder? Explorer? Yeah, and I bet you thought all those Ford commercials were shot in Australia!

Our resident hacker recently broke into the NASA computer and unearthed secret photographs from the Mars mission revealing :sd[beat] what else? MORE ROCKS! Top Secret Classified rocks which we now reveal to you at great personal risk:

- Rutabaga Rock
- Cop Rock
- "Crocodile" Dundee in his new Ford Explorer Rock
- Rock over London, Rock on Chicago and
- Adult Contemporary

Watch now as the Band forms its favorite -- Schoolhouse Rock -- and regresses.

And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, the Brown University Band is proud to welcome the Lusitana Band!

:sd[Band forms a concert arch, Lusitana Band marches in from visitor-side sideline playing "Oragar"]

The Lusitana Band hails from the Lusitana Youth Club in sunny Cumberland, Rhode Island, which, at 75 years of age, is one of the oldest Portuguese-American social clubs in New England. Watch now as the two bands, conducted by the Lusitana Band’s Maestro Joao Soares [Zhao Suarez] plays "Vinho do Porto" [Veenyu du Portu].

:sd[Both bands form bottle, play "Vinho do Porto"]

Smashing dahlinks! And now, Brown University Director of Bands Matt McGarrell will lead the bands in a rendition of "Brown Man Born."

:sd[Both bands form "B" and play "Brown Man Born"]

Be here next week when the Brown Bears bother, bust and bash the braindead babies from beantown and the Band once again welcomes those wacky Big Nazo boys.
