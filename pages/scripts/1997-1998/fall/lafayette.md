## Pregame:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has recently accepted a large anonymous donation from an anonymous donor who wishes that his name remain unknown, it's the Brown University Turner Network Corporation Band!

OK, so maybe we're not exactly the UN, but at least as far as fundraising goes we make sure our vice president keeps his hands clean. That didn't stop Janet Reno however from appointing a Special Prosecutor to investigate our Script Committee. Hey, good luck! Not even we know exactly who they are and where they come up with this stuff.

:sd[Band forms "B" and plays "Brown Cheering Song"]

:sd[Band plays National Anthem on cue (?)]

## Halftime:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization with a three pack a day habit, it's the Brown University "Uncommonly Smooth" BAND!

Brown Student Agencies announced at the beginning of this year that they would start selling cigarettes in Faunce House. Rumor has it that this is soon to be followed by the opening of a liquor store in List Art Center, a new Guns â€˜N' Ammo Emporium at the Sarah-Doyle Women's Center, and a stockpile of discount weapons-grade Plutonium in University Hall. BSA claims that their decision was motivated by their concern that addicted students were being price-gouged by local convenience stores with a monopoly. Apparently, BSA was also concerned by the threat to their own monopoly-- :sd[beat] on price gouging. We can only wonder if next on their agenda might be taking on that guy with the dreadlocks who hangs out in front of Store 24.

Watch now as the band staves off a nic-fit and takes you where the flavor is.

This is the part of the show where we ordinarily make fun of the opposing team's school. The only problem is, we know nothing about Lafayette except that the name sounds vaguely French. Mind you, we can make jokes about France until the cows come home, but really what's the point?

So we figured that instead maybe you could tell us some jokes for a change.

:sd[Silence]

C'mon, just stand up and belt one right out.

:sd[(A moment of) Silence (for the Titanic)]

Anybody? Aaaanybody?

OK, fine! Watch now as the band forms a little teeny college on a hill and serenades you once again.

On the International front, the United States is one of the few countries who chose not to sign the recent treaty banning land mines. President Clinton is on record explaining that he doesn't want to agree to the treaty until our military is done exploring (and I quote) "Other alternatives."

In an effort to bring the US into compliance, the Brown Band has the following suggestions for alternatives:

:::script-list

- A) Banana peels
- B) Really tall grass
- C) A great big sheet of flypaper
- D) A polite sign reading "Please Do Not Cross This Field"
- E) Rabid dogs buried up to their necks\
  or
- F) The Princeton Band

:::

Watch now as we form the ideal solution and play "Every Landmine Needs Somebody to Maim."

:sd[Band forms a "B" and plays "Everybody . . . "]

Next week Bruno travels to the Bronx to fight Fordham. We won't be there because we have to wash our hair. Join us in two weeks however when Brown tackles the tigers on home turf.
