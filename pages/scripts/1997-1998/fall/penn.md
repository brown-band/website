## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, freshman mothers and fathers (and their parents), presenting an organization that needs no introduction, because you’d all be happier if we’d stayed at home, it’s the “Yale Precision Marching Band!”

:sd[Band tumbles haphazardly onto field]

So, you guys wanna hear some jokes? Ahhh, who needs jokes? We’ll just spend all our time talking about how much we hate Harvard... that makes us laugh! Man those Harvard kids are dumb.

:sd[Band yells “How dumb are they?”]

:sd[snicker] They’re just really stupid!

:sd[Band forms a rancid lemon and plays “Championship”]

Watch now as the Failed Incision Marching Bland forms a “B” for bulldogs and borrows a fight song from a school in a REALLY SMALL state! Get it? Rhode Island is SMALL! It’sa laff riot!

:sd[Band forms a “B” and plays “Bring the Victory”]

:sd[Band marches off to #1]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, freshman mothers and fathers (and their parents), presenting an organization that wonders why it even bothers with a script because you Penn yahoos are gonna be booing us too loud to hear it anyway, it’s the Brown University “Hey! Get your foot out of my astroturf!” BAND!

:sd[Band takes to plastic grass]

Recently, the University formerly known as Penn State has found itself the target of a lawsuit. It seems that Penn tried to shut down a nearby pinball arcade and, while such Gestapo tactics might have worked in the days of Ben Franklin, in these litigious times they just don’t fly.

Penn’s President Rodin even had her day in court, despite her protests that she was too busy sculpting and destroying downtown Tokyo to testify. Or to run a respected university for that matter. Fortunately, her only current obligation in this department is the subpoena.

University Pinball is located across the street from the Penn school of dentistry, and the owners claim that it was not their clientele causing the disturbances, but rather Penn students wigged out on nitrous oxide. In fact, in their lawsuit they claim that their patrons were often scared off by the bloodcurdling screams that were the result of would-be dentists filling the cavities of improperly anaesthetized subjects.

Watch now as the Brown University “Hey! Get your foot out of my mouth!” Band forms a syringe full of novicaine and goes cruising.

:sd[Band forms syringe and plays “Minor Pregame (Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse Theme)”]

The band was saddened to learn that its presence at today’s football game would prevent it from attending the Million Woman March. We’re sure that the Penn Band is equally if not more saddened, as participation in the march would have earned them three credits.

It seems that everybody is hopping on the march bandwagon these days, and it’s not even November! What’s next? Keep your eyes peeled for the Million Water Buffalo March next February. For now, watch as the band takes a look back at the Promise Keepers looking back to the stone age and plays “Patriarchy Forevermore” aka “Hey! Get your foot out of my phallocentric dogma!” while forming man’s simplest tool. :sd[beat] No, not a Penn student... the wedge!

:sd[Band forms a wedge and plays “Brown Forevermore”]

The band was reading the papers recently and we’re shocked, SHOCKED we tell you, to learn that college students drink booze! I tell ya, Woodward and Bernstein have nothing on the intrepid souls responsible for unearthing this revalation. What’ll they come up with next?

READ ALL ABOUT IT!

People eat turkey on Thanksgiving!\
Sugar causes tooth decay!\
Penn student body consists entirely of people wait-listed at Columbia!

For the final word on college drinking we turn to no less than Ben Franklin himself who says:

“We founding fathers never drank too much-- we were too busy growing hemp. Hey! Get your foot out of my beer, Sam Adams!”

:sd[Band forms a “B” and plays “Joshua”]

Join us next week when Brown takes on Cornell at home. Until then, sit back and enjoy the only band in the Ivy League with a corporate sponsorship. Hey! Get your foot out of my tagline!

:sd[Band marches off to #1]
