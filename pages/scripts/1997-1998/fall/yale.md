## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, secret society members, and all you members of the New Haven Local #369 Papparazzi Trade Union, presenting an organization that runs the tightest band in the banding business, it’s the Brown University 3rd day air track BAND!

:sd[Band strikes out onto field]

The recent opening of a strip club less than a bone’s throw away from the Yale campus has been the cause of a major uproar. We in the Brown Band, however, believe that it should be viewed as a positive thing. Why? Well, it gives Yalies plenty of interesting, er, internship opportunities. Not to mention that it’s certain to increase Yale’s national, or at least local, exposure. Plus it gives us a chance to get back at you guys for all those Heidi Mattson jokes.

Another addition to the New Haven business scene is the Image Tattoo Parlor. Locals were reassured that it was going to be a clean and sanitary business, but are still concerned over rumors that Image plans to hire a recently out-of-work celebrity to do their ear piercings-- :sd[beat] Mike Tyson.

Watch now as the Brown Band forms an artifact of Iron Mike’s handicraft and plays "Championship (Deferred)" aka "I Coulda Been The Champ if it Weren’t for That Chomp."

On the legal front, several Yale students are planning on suing the University because the co-ed housing situation violates their religion. This has inspired several other Yale student groups to file their own suits:

- The Yale Pundits are planning to sue because they are forced to live with one or two students who actually realize that their pranks are neither clever nor well executed
- The Yale Model Congress plans to sue because they are forced to live with people who actually have a life
- The Yale Objectivist Study Group plans to sue because they are forced to live with the worthless scum of the earth who are too small-minded to recognize the genius and infallibility of Ayn Rand
- And of course, the Yale Band plans to sue for mental distress due to the fact that they are forced to live side by side :sd[beat] with actual musicians

In fact, in a recent poll 90% of Yale students said that as far as housing goes, they envy the Russian Cosmonauts up on MIR, even though the station is losing valuable components faster than Paula Jones is losing lawyers.

Watch now as the Band forms the MIR space station and plays "Entropy Forevermore."

The Yale administration recently refused a sizeable donation from Seinfeld’s Kramer to endow a chair in Bursting Into Rooms Unannounced Studies. The Brown Band had not been aware that Kramer was a Yalie, but we’re not terribly surprised, as he certainly looks the part.

On the subject of celebrities, Claire Danes has decided to attend Yale :sd[beat] at some point in the distant future. Danes’ last role as Juliet in the recent Shakespeare remake, which was set in a bleak, apocalyptic urban nightmare, was probably good preparation for life in New Haven. Contrary to popular belief, though, Daines will not put her career on hold while at Yale, but will instead start filming a new documentary series-- "My So-Called University."

Watch now as the Brown Band forms Danes’ greatest asset (and we’re not talking acting ability here folks) and looks forward to our next visit to Yale in two years, by which time we fully expect that she will be a member of the illustrious Skull &amp; Bones Society.

:sd[Band forms a "B" and plays "Time Warp."]

Join us next week when the Brown Bears take on Lafayette at home, rather than going all the way to France. For now, watch as the Brown Band once again flushes itself down the Yale Bowl.

:sd[Band runs around in a circle, spiraling inward and finally funneling off the field.]
