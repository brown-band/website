> _The idea to write a show in verse was suggested to me at the 1996 Ivy Band Conference by the Columbia Band's Chief Scribe, who had done it the year before. At the beginning of this year, I went to the Columbia Band's webpage and read their verse script only to discover that, although it was all in rhymed couplets, it regularly switched meters. So, in order to make the idea my own I decided to use blank verse-- iambic pentameter of course. And, of course, it would have to be for the Columbia game._
>
> _The game itself wasn't too terribly interesting. It was cold. It was wet. We creamed 'em. After our half-time show we had the transfer of power ceremony, meaning that I'm no longer president of the Brown Band. I'm also no longer Script Chair. I've decided to resign and let someone else take over for the few shows we do second semester. It's been a good... three years!? have I really been writing these suckers that long? Well, here's my swan song: **- CB '98**._

## Pregame

Alumni, Ladies, gentlemen and friends\
Today to prick your fancy we present\
The only group on campus with the guts\
To say out loud "We gotcher Spam© right HERE!"

THE BROWN UNIVERSITY BAND!

:sd[Enter BAND]

:sd[BAND forms football (AKA the Circle of Fifths after one fifth too many), sounds sporting fanfare]

Today arrives the last game of the Fall\
And so there are some seniors who this day\
Their final time do stride upon this field\
To make you laugh, their instruments to play\
For soon the Wickle gates by snapping shut\
From Iv'ry tower bliss will sever them.\
So now comes time to laud them to the gods\
And sing truncated sonnets to those sods.

:sd[BAND forms champagne glass]

Zach Litvack plays percussion for our band\
His dad produces television shows\
By end of year diploma in his hand\
He'll stay in Brunoland. How long? Who knows?\
For our beloved bandmate Zachary\
Now and forever is P. L. M. E.

:sd[Sound fanfare]

And new this year: James Todd, our figurehead.\
He joined the band to brandish his big stick.\
Not just drum major, think of him instead\
‘Sthe fellow seeing that one "Kathy" chyk.\
In four years was he loath to graduate\
So stayed a fifth just for the steady date.

:sd[fanfare]

Sweet sister Susan Huang conducts our band,\
And in the time left over toots the flute.\
She summons music with her gest'ring hand\
And when she stops the whole band does fall mute.\
Or so the theory goes, though I must say:\
The band does sometimes have the odd off day.

:sd[fanfare]

{Another senior: Jenn from the wood Green\
She is forsooth a lusty, buxom lass\
So for our band she plays the tambourine\
And shows us all that she's got quite some :sd[beat] class.\
And no doubt when she leave these ivied walls,\
The world will see she's got quite a set of teeth.}

:sd[fanfare]

Hail to the chief! Bob Chapman is his name,\
For two terms as the prez he ruled our crew.\
A bandie likely destined for great fame\
He is the smartest and best looking too.\
Oh and before I just forget to say:\
He wrote the very script you hear today.

So don't complain his ego is too loud\
For writing one more stanza based on him.\
Of writing scripts in verse he is quite proud,\
And when he graduates it is his whim\
To follow Matson's footsteps left and right\
And _Ivy Leaguer Slacker_ quickly write.

:sd[fanfare]

So wish good luck t'our seniors all and one.\
We hope four years in band have all been fun.\
Wish good luck to our seniors one and all!\
We hope they're not all homeless :sd[beat] by next Fall.

:sd[followed by songs of patriotic nature]

## Halftime

Alumni, Ladies, Gentlemen and friends\
Today for your amusement we present\
A group that has its eyes set on Iraq\
Cos we're da bomb. . .

THE BROWN UNIVERSITY BAND!

:sd[Enter BAND]

Comparisons are odious, ‘tis true,\
But after seeing that last band in blue\
Suspect do I that you will think this way:\
"Zounds! Odious new meaning found today."

And so our mission stands now to compare\
The Rotten Apple with out own towne fair.

The Pawxatucket River is no gem,\
However in comparison you'll find\
Next to the Hudson ‘tis like Evian\
With crystal waters glist'ning in the sun.

There's something rotten in the state of New York!

{The band in blue, if rumor doesn't lie,\
Once tripped and fell into the Hudson foul.\
Although the tale sounds tall to my trained ears,\
It cert'nly would explain a thing or two.\
An ancient mystery at last is solved:\
THAT'S what befell the powder-blue clad crew!\
An ancient mystery at last is solved:\
THAT'S why the lion looks more like a Smurf!}

So now the Band salutes a waterway,\
Which unlike the New York Times is still quite grey,\
By forming fast a water molecule\
And playing "Smells Like Diesel Engine Fuel."

:sd[BAND forms dihydrogen oxide, plays "Smells Like Teen Spirit"]

Now to us it would come as no surprise\
If that C-U-M-B did dis' our burg.\
They seem to be obsessed, forsooth, with size\
And pointing out a fact that we all learned\
Back in our kindergarten days with maps\
But seems to some a revalation new:\
Rhode Island is, in truth, the smallest state,\
But I knew that already, didn't you?

We're sure they didn't mean to be so mean,\
They're all just homesick for their own home scene,\
So now the Band forms South America\
And plays sweet soothing music for those Smurfs.

:sd[Band forms South America and plays #4]

Providence, for all it is divine,\
Does have a few things less than optimal.\
The local cops are no great miracle\
Those meter maids, however, never tire!\
Our Money Man and our Vice President\
Last week ten tickets did accumulate\
between them which they now must quickly pay--\
The BOOT awaits their cars if they are late.\
The Denver Boot our topic now becomes:\
We hate those ugly yellow tire clams.\
Which is to say we all do knock the boots,\
And so this is the subject for our band.

:sd[BAND forms a boot and momentarily ponders playing "I Hear You Knocking But You Can't Come In" before launching into "All Day & All of the Night"]

The sponsor for the Brown Band's halftime show,\
Is Shakespeare Beer, the beer that shakes your Globe.

See you all next football season!

:sd[Exit BAND, playing #1]
