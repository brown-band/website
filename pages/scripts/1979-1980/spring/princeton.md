Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, it’s Saturday night! And it’s time for the Mr. Bill Show. We’re going to send Mr. Bill to the Princeton Eating Clubs. Look, here comes dinner.

:sd[Mr. Bill] Oh Boy !

Look what’s being served. :sd[Sing] Here comes Mr. Bill’s dog.

:sd[Mr. Bill] Oh noooooooooo!!! Mr. Band, you shouldn’t be so mean to me.

Look, Mr. Bill, a letter for <u>you</u>. It’s from the United States Army. It says, “Greetings, please report to Seargent Sluggo immediately.” But first, you’ll have to go to Faunce House for a haircut.

:sd[Mr. Bill] Oh nooo! Nooooo!!! Not that!!! Please... Noooooooooooo!

:sd[The band has formed Mr. Bill’s face. As the play “You’re in the Army Now,” Mr. Bill’s hair is cut off by a skating pair of scissors.]

Now we’re going to send Mr. Bill through Congress.

:sd[Mr. Bill] Oh, that tickles.

Well, Mr. Bill, you made it through Congress intact. Here comes the Chief Executive. It’s President Sluggo. Uh oh, he’s going to veto you, Mr. Bill.

:sd[Mr. Bill] Oh NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

:sd[The face of Mr. Bill is stamped out by a skating rubber stamp which hits Mr. Bill’s head on the top and crushes him to nothing.]

The Band will now play “In a Gadda Da Veto.” :sd[The band plays “In a Gadda Da Vida.”]

:sd[The horn section plays the Dueling Banjo song.]

Be back in two weeks when the Internationally Famous Brown University Skating Band completes its rendition of “Dueling Band Joes.”

:sd[The band counter skates to “Ever True.”]
