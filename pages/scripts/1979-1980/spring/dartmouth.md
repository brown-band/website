Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you nine hole greens, reemed by satellite from Lake Placid, New York, it’s the official band of the 1980 Olympics, the Brown University Band of Gold.

Spanning the rink to bring you the trill of victory :sd[Piccolos do a little trill] and the agony of de feet :sd[Band grabs feet in agony].

:sd[The band has now formed the 5 Olympic rings. “Eugler’s Dream” is played.]

This evening we bring you highlights of Zamboni racing, supine skiing, disfigured skating, and the CS 51 kluge run. But, first, we bring you live coverage of the speed skating competition. (Two band memters speed skate around the band in Olympic speed skating style.)

And now a new event at this year’s Olympics. In addition to the speed skating, we bring the first heat of the Qualuude skating competition. :sd[Two members skate as if they had just consumed many Qualuudes.]

We have just recieved the results of the skating band event. In third place was Sister Sled with We Are Far off Key. In second place was the Olympic Village People with Macho Band. And here with their winning routine is the Brown Band.

:sd[The band has formed a 6-pointed asterisk on the ice. This asterisk rotates. As people on the ends of the asterisk reach the top or bottom, they skate off into a circle which encircles the asterisk. When the asterisk is empty, the whole band is now skating in a circle. This is all done to the quiescent strains of “Ever True to Brown.”]

Be back in September when the Brown Band plays in our new environmentally controlled indoor football stadium.
