<sd>Band runs out of a set of bathroom stalls</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Crimson Pimpernels, it's the Brown University Recently Relieved Band.
</sp>
<sp>
Well, it looks like the Band has just come out of the water closet. And now some quotes in reference to our Princeton show, from a local weekly newsletter of unknown origin. It stated that our show was, quote, "sleezy," and that our halftime antics consisted of, quote, "infantile bathroom humor."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The Band forms the word "sleezy" on the field</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
In rebuttal, sleazy was mispelled. The correct spelling is S-L-E-A-Z-Y.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The Band forms "slaezy" on the field and is quickly whilstled into a square between the 5 and 15 yard lines of Harvard</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Besides that, we're not infantile, we're sophomoric! And by the way, BATHROOM HUMOR?? Do you see <em>any</em> bathroom humor in this show. The only bathroom humor here today is the Harvard Johns. In honor of that distinguished "potty" we form a Harvard Square and play "Stall Walls." <sd>The Band plays "Star Wars"</sd>.
</sp>
<sp>
And now, what you've all been waiting for: we salute a highly acclaimed, prestigious Ivy League school. <sd>Band looks toward Hahvahd stands</sd>. <em>No,</em> you sillies, not there! It's Brown we're saluting. You know, as in "Ever True to <em>Brown</em>" and "<em>Brown</em> Forevermore."
</sp>
<sp>
Watch now as, for the third time, the Brown Band <em>DOES THE IMPOSSIBLE</em> on the field.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Playing Brown songs, the Band marches into "Brown" in script</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Ladies and Gentlemen, will you please rise for the Brown University Alma Mater.
</sp>
<sp>
Be back in two weeks when we ask the musical question, "How do you spell Rolaids?"
</sp>
