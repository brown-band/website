## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Disco Lovers Everywhere, it’s the Brown University Saturday Afternoon Fever Band. Disco music, disco dancing, and disco rollerskating have become a highly important, greatly loved part of our culture. And now, disco music has come to Brown. In the fine disco tradition, we bring you the Brown University Disco Course Catalog. First in our book is:

- Disco Chem 12 -- where your partner is unkown\
  Then there’s
- Disco economics -- where it’s _assumed_ that you already know how to dance\
  And
- Disco Thermodynamics or "Disco Inferno"
- Disco Reli Stu or "Heaven Knows"
- Disco Child Psych or "Love to Love You Baby"
- Disco CS 101 or "Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Stayin’ Alive, Stayin’ Alive"
- Disco Voice & Diction or "You Got A Cute Way of Talkin’"
- Disco Ornithology or "Disco Duck"\
  And finally
- Disco Topics in Human Sexuality, taught by "Disco Dick Dannenfelser."

Come on and get down as we form a sad excuse for happy feet and play "Copacabana."

:sd[Band forms a pair of shoe soles and plays the Barry Manilow favorite.]

Turning from Disco to Crisco, from Crisco to Frisco, and from Frisco to Hollywood, the Band stops in at one of those insipid daytime television game shows. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Dating Game.

:sd[The Band splits into three separate bands and plays "Tijuana Taxi"]

Our first contestant is Brunella B. Bruno (Tim Bruno, the Brown Bear, in drag). She’s majoring in animal husbandry at Cornell University. Her measurements? She’s a svelte 85-93-87. Her favorite things are honey, cookies, (a la Yogi Bear), pic-a-nic baskets, and a little bit of pawing around. Yay hay hay hee!

Hidden from Brunella we have 3 handsome, unattached bands. Say hello Band #1. :sd[Band #1 waves] Band #2... :sd[#2 blows a kiss]. And Band #3... :sd[#2 does foxy hip sway]. And now the questions...

Band #1, I take you back to my cozy den in the woods and put on some nice music. Why would I have a better time dancing with you in my cave than with Band #2? :sd[Band #1 plays "I’ve Got Rhythm"]. Band #2, what do you think of Band #1? :sd[Band #2 plays "Mickey Mouse March"]. Band #3, if you had a chance to take a long luxurious bubble bath with anyone in the world, who would you choose? :sd[Band #3 plays "Rubber Duckie"].

:sd[Entire band plays a "dischord"].

That’s it. Okay Brunella, it’s almost time to decide. :sd[Band plays some "Tijuana Taxi"]. Which Band did you choose? Was it Band #1? :sd[They play a chord]. Band #2? :sd[They play a higher chord]. Or Band #3? :sd[They play highest chord].

Band #2? Congratulations #2. :sd[Bands #1 and #3 jump for joy. Band #2 runs away chased by Brunella].

You and Brunella, and you chaperone, are going on an all expense-paid, weekend excursion to... Columbia University! Where you can... uh... um... uh... Well, at least you’ll be glad when it’s over.

That’s all for now, folks!

See you in Meehan where the world’s only, and best, skating band slays you with silly satire and subsequently serenades you with satisfying sounds.

:sd[March off to "Ever True"].
