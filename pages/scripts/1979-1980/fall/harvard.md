## Halftime

:sd[Band runs out of a set of bathroom stalls]

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Crimson Pimpernels, it’s the Brown University Recently Relieved Band.

Well, it looks like the Band has just come out of the water closet. And now some quotes in reference to our Princeton show, from a local weekly newsletter of unknown origin. It stated that our show was, quote, “sleezy,” and that our halftime antics consisted of, quote, “infantile bathroom humor.”

:sd[The Band forms the word “sleezy” on the field]

In rebuttal, sleazy was mispelled. The correct spelling is S-L-E-A-Z-Y.

:sd[The Band forms “slaezy” on the field and is quickly whilstled into a square between the 5 and 15 yard lines of Harvard]

Besides that, we’re not infantile, we’re sophomoric! And by the way, BATHROOM HUMOR?? Do you see _any_ bathroom humor in this show. The only bathroom humor here today is the Harvard Johns. In honor of that distinguished “potty” we form a Harvard Square and play “Stall Walls.” :sd[The Band plays “Star Wars”].

And now, what you’ve all been waiting for: we salute a highly acclaimed, prestigious Ivy League school. :sd[Band looks toward Hahvahd stands]. _No,_ you sillies, not there! It’s Brown we’re saluting. You know, as in “Ever True to _Brown_” and “_Brown_ Forevermore.”

Watch now as, for the third time, the Brown Band _DOES THE IMPOSSIBLE_ on the field.

:sd[Playing Brown songs, the Band marches into “Brown” in script]

Ladies and Gentlemen, will you please rise for the Brown University Alma Mater.

Be back in two weeks when we ask the musical question, “How do you spell Rolaids?”
