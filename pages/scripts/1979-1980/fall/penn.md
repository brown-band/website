## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Penncreatic Ulcers, Heeeeere's the Band!

:sd[All but one of the Band members are on the field in concert formation. That one band member not on the field runs on to the tune of "Johnny's Theme"]

How about that Penn Band? They're really dumb. :sd["HOW DUMB ARE THEY?" yells the Band]. They're soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo dumb that:\

- they think serial repetition means eating breakfast twice.
- they think Gerry Ford is going out of business.
- they tried to order out at the Tower of Pisa.
- they think contraception is a football play.
- they think the joint chiefs of staff are a bunch of dope pushers.
- and they think this show is funny.

The Band forms a thick stick, a monolog \[sic], and plays "Jumpin' at the Woodside."

We've really got a good show today. Our first guest is Frank Rizzo. What? He's not here? Oh well, I guess the Old Grey Mayor Ain't What He Used To Be.

Our next guests are a new singing group that believes the human race is devolving. And after our visit here at Penn, we tend to agree with them. Listen now to the sentimental strains of that unforgettable, heartwarming classic "As Time Goes By."

:sd[The band forms the letters "DEVO" and plays the "As Time Goes By" Devo style.]

Stay tuned, we'll be back in a minute. But first, a public service message on behalf of the University of Pennsylvania. :sd[Whistle and the band starts to form "PS"].

The University of Pennsylvania, a state school, was founded in 1855. Its beautiful, rustic main campus is located at University Park near the geographic center of Pennsylvania. The U Penn Nittany Lions, under head coach Joe Paterno, have compiled a record of.... What? What? Philadelphia? Uh...back to you band.

:sd[Immediately, the Band plays the last couple of notes of "Hawaii Five-0." Drummers ad-lib].

Thanks, Doc. Well, it's time to go now. Listen and enjoy as the Band plays "Exodus."

This show has been brought to you by Esoterica, the age spot remover that no-one understands.

:sd[March off on yard lines to "Ever True"].
