## Halftime

:sd[The show is done in the accent of a Jewish grandmother].

Ladies and Gentlement, Friends and Alumni,... SHALOM! It's the Brown University Meshugina, Mamzer Band. Notice our yamakas?

Let's eat dinner. Hmm, we've got stuffed haddock. Looks like some guy-filta-fish. Would you Passover the Roast Hashanah please? Purim some apple Seder, will you? More fish? Yum, Kippers will be fine. But take a tip from us and try the briss-kit. Enough of this kosher bologna! Watch now as we get rabbinical approval and play "Everything's Coming Up."

:sd[The band forms a "U" with a circle around it, the kosher symbol, and plays "Everything's Coming Up Roses"].

And now let's talk about 5739 years of Jewish suffering? First both temples were destroyed? Then the automatic icemaker broke? We couldn't get good help. The Chinese restaurant burned down? And, vay iz mere, Sadie's gallbladder.

But as if 5739 of suffering isn't enough, here's the Band's mother.

Where's the Brown Band's mother? Don't invite me? I'll listen to you on the record. I should throw myself under a train, you don't enough. There's 3 kinds of people: doctors, lawyers and bums. You want you should be bums?

Shep machus fum der kinder, Mom. How about some chicken soup? It'll make you feel better. Listen as teh Band plays "Oi, Could Have Kvetched All Night."

:sd[The band plays "I Could Have Danced All Night" and forms a bowl of matzo ball soup].

We now salute the Bloome of Jewish young womanhood, the Jewish American Princess. This species can be recognized by the following distinguishing characteristics:

:::

We salute this cultural phenom, form a Princess Phone, and play "This could Be the Start of Something Expensive!"

:sd[The Band plays "This Could Be The Start of Something Big"].

Be back in two years when the Band turns the other cheek and gets hit by the other fist.

:sd[March off to "Ever True"]
