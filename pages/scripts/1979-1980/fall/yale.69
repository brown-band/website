Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you pooped out, pampered, preppie puppies, it's the one and only Brown University Half-Gassed but Fully-Tanked Band.

Having nearly spent our small reservoir of that precious natural fluid, petroleum, we're fast heading for a mounting crisis. We suggest these alternative power sources:<sbr/>
<ul><li>We can harness the pre-med who can heat his dorm by burning the midnight oil.</li><li>In the U.S. alone, there is estimated to be over 25 million nuclear families. This is a huge, untapped energy source.</li><li>We can set afire previously unrealized combustables such as Cayuga's waters and Harvard's curriculum requirements.</li><li>In addition, energy will be conserved if unnecessary night time driving can be curtailed with nocturnal emission controls.</li></ul>
</sp>

Unfortunately, such innovation from the government is about as likely as Playboy doing a spread on Ivy League women. The band gets an empty tank, and from the hit musical, "Geysers and Dollars," we play "Roll Out the Oil Barrel."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The band forms a gas gauge, with the pointer going from full to empty</sd>.
</sp>
<sp>
The supposed source of our skyrocketing oil prices is those OPECers in the Middle East, where the bywords of the day are "Ayatollah so!" or "life is strife." Nevertheless, the band would lie to salute Israeli and Egyptian overtures toward international harmony. <sd>The band forms a peace sign</sd>. Our musical program includes "Begin (Bay-gin) the Beguine" and "Anwar Egyptian Soldiers," followed by "Side by Side" and "Tea for Two"...

<sli><em>2nd voice:</em> Wait right there Brown Band!</sli>
<sli><em>Band voice:</em> What's going on here?</sli>
<sli><em>2nd voice:</em> Quiet! I have taken over! The Band of Rebels now plays "Yassir, That's My Baby"</sli>
<sli><em>Band voice after song:</em> Can't we talk about this? Let's negotiate.</sli>
<sli><em>Jimmy Carter:</em> I'm sorry, but I overheard that and I'll have to ask for the band's resignation. And I hope none of you out there recognize this formation or I'll have to ask for your resignations too.</sli>
<sli><em>Karl Malden:</em> What will the brown Band do? What Wilbur... (a la Mr. Ed) What <em>will</em> they do? <sd>Band feels for its traveller's checks</sd>.</sli>

Where will we go? Perhaps to Chrysler, perhaps to Yale. The choice is simple -- fossil fuels or fossil fools. And yet, there are amazing similarities between the two corporations. Chrysler has a massive inventory of outmoded, oversized, sluggish models. Yale has a football team. Both Chrysler and Yale over overinflated, overpriced and over a mile of out of Providence. Finally, like Chrysler, Yale will soon need to offer rebates to its matriculants. You can:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>Go to Davenport College, and get a check,</sli>
<sli>Go to Calhoun, and get a check,</sli>
<sli>Go to Saybrook, and get a check,</sli>
<sli>Go to Sillman, and get a check.</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
We think you get the idea. Saluting the Yalies, we play "You've Still Got Plenty of Nothing."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The band forms a dollar sign which changes to a cents sign</sd>.
</sp>
<sp>
Be back in two years when we'll excite you once more with our precision march and drill.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>March off to "Ever True" on yard lines</sd>.
