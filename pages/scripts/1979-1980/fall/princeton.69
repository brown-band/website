Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you freshmen mothers and fathers, and their parents, its the Brown University Never Never Band. Welcome to the land of make-believe, the land of freshman parent's weekend, the land of Brutopia...<sbr/>
<ul><li>where we always have delicious juicy roast beef for lunch</li><li>where there <i>is</i> no Princeton band</li><li>where the school newspaper is objective and truthful. No, not even in the land of make-believe.</li></ul>
</sp>
<sp>
But at least here in fantasy land, the Band performs wholesome, family entertainment. And now, a bedtime story.
</sp>
<sp>
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a fair young maiden who lived all alone. She grew flowers in her garden but was very, very lonely. Along came her fairy godfather who wiggled his magic wand and... oops, let's try again.
</sp>
<sp>
Once upon a time, there was a handsome young prince who was in love with a young maiden who lived in a castle across the way. Her father, the evil wizard, had surrounded the castle with an enchanted briar patch. The young prince whipped out his sword in order to penetrate the bush. Wait a minute! Who wrote this?

This time we'll tell something we know is clean. Little Red Riding Hood was skipping through the woods with her basket full for goodies for Grandma. When she got there, the wolf was disguised in the old lady's clothes. "My what big teeth you have, Grandma!" Little Red exclaimed innocently. "The better to eat you with." <sd>Pause</sd> Oh well, maybe next week. <sd>While each story is being read, the Band skips in and out of the word "SMUT"</sd>.
</sp>
<sp>
The Band tries to clean up its act, forms a bar of Ivory Soap, 99 44/100 % puerile, and plays "Mission Impossible."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The Band forms a rectangle with 99 in the middle changing to a 69, in spirit with the show</sd>.

In the land of make-believe, words are often deceiving. Here's a list of common words and phrases and what they really mean.
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>doing a bowl - means taking a RISD ceramics class</sli>
<sli>shiksa - the polish sausage at the Ratty</sli>
<sli>being deflowered - dropping out of Botany class</sli>
<sli>having crabs - taking invertebrate biology instead</sli>
<sli>bong - the sounds of the bell in Carrie tower</sli>
<sli>and prophylactics - what you wear on your feet when it rains</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
The Band makes jive on the field and plays "Colloquial Gas."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The Band wanders aimlessly in a blob while playing "Classical Gas"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Turning from phrases to deoxyribonuclases, the Band looks at the new genes being designed in Wilson Lab. Last we heard they were cloning a mutant bacterial strain often known to sport ugly black and orange plaid jackets and funny looking styrofoam hats. Oh my God, they've escaped! We've got to neutralize them! Quick, splice their genes, unzip their DNA, denature their base pairs, and give them a dose of their own medicine. Watch now as the Band forms the famous Brown University Double Rotating "B" and plays "Penicillin from Heaven."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The band forms a double "B" and each member rotates on his/her own axis.</sd>

<sul><sli>There once was a group that was bland,</sli><sli>From New Jersey, a bleak, barren land.</sli><sul><sli>They made lots of noise</sli><sli>And had little poise</sli></sul><sli>It was F. <i>the Princeton Band.</i></sli></sul>

<sd>March off on yard lines to the tune of "Ever True"</sd><sbr/>
