Now for our 2nd feature. It Came From Outer Space - a strange extra-galactic spore, the seed to some unknown, no doubt deadly, but nonetheless lowly, form of life. Some scientists believed it to be a virus. Others said it was some primitive form of slime-mold. Only we knew the horrifying truth. It was the Harvard band.

<sd>The band plays "Everything's Coming Up Roses." Two concentric circles are formed. The inside circle skates clockwise and backwards. The outside circle skates normally counterclockwise. In the middle are 12 band members on their back with their heads in towards the middle. As the song is played, these band members open and close their legs in perfect rhythm.</sd>

Jackie Gleason, eat your heart out. Be back in 1980 when the band takes a look at the sociological impact of Pin Sol on middle-aged America.
