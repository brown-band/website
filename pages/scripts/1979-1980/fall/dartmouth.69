Ladies and Gentlemen, we invited all the bands in the Ivy League to take the Dartmouth Challenge. Could they survive 7 minutes -- that's 420 nonillion nanoseconds -- in the Dartmouth stadium alone? Only one band had the gonads to accept this challenge. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Yale University Precision Marching Band. Let's go, Bulldogs, if you want to win that beautiful, 18-setting Tupperware party ensemble, you'd better come out now!
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The band creeps out slowly and then breaks into a run to the 45, with saxes and trombones leading the pack, their instruments playing the part of submachine guns</sd>.
</sp>
<sp>
It looks like they've opted for the classic slide trombone, right wing saxophone defense. Searching for a tactical advantage in this 7 minute struggle, the Band enlists the help of "General MacArthur Park." <sd>Band plays "MacArthur Park"</sd>.
</sp>
<sp>
Hit the dirt! <sd>Band hits the dirt</sd>. Now serpentine! Serpentine. <sd>Band serpentines, serpentines</sd>. Wait a minute; we've been had. What seems to be the Yale Band is actually the... Harvard Band cleverly disguised. <sd>Band rips Y's off their sweaters, exposing H's</sd>.
</sp>
<sp>
Enough of this deception! We have it from an inside source that you're actually... The Princeton Band. <sd>Off with H's, exposing P's</sd>. Maybe they'll try to bore the Dartmouth students to death with the "Infamous Princeton University Double Rotating P."
</sp>
<sp>
What now? The Band shakes uncontrollably. <sd>Band shakes uncontrollably</sd>. Do they have:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A) Acrophobia - like the fear of being high, man.</sli>
<sli>B) Claustrophobia - the fear of opening Christmas present.</sli>
<sli>C) Phobophobia - the fear of fear itself.</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
No, it's just the frigid climate here. The Band forms frost crystals and plays "Come on Baby Light My Fireplace."
</sp>
<sp>
Hold it Band! <sd>The Band stops short</sd>. I know you're glad to be alive after almost 6 minutes, but you've got to go the distance, else, no Tupperware!
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms the word Bruno</sd>.
</sp>
<sp>
Something has to be done. <sd>Said verrry ssslowly</sd>.There's no way to stall for time against this extremely intelligent, highly educated crowd. Holy Harrowing Halftime shows, Batman, we've done it! We've won! <sd>Band rips off P's, exposing B's</sd>. 
</sp>
<sp>
Ladies and Gentlymen, Friends and Alumni, Blutarsky, Pinto, and Flounder, it's the Brown University, Yes, We'd Do It Again Band.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band plays "Ever True" twice, marching off in formation the second time through</sd>.
