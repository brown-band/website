## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all ewe little lambs lost, presenting the pride of Fox Point, that *Ram*bunctious Band, with its _salt_ and _peter_ drum majors and those tittilating twirlers, Fanny Waver and Ophelia Bottoms.

It’s time to strike up the Band!

During the strike, URI students couldn’t learn because of missing faculties. Fortunately, the differences were settled when both sides adopted compromising positions. But now the Brown Band is on strike _and we’re demanding._ Also, we’d like to request:

- that Brown University appoint a Dean of Residential Lounges
- that food be served in the Ratty
- and that URI declare open season on the Ramettes.

The Band _zips down_ to the courthouse, presses its union suit against the university and plays “Gotta Fly Now.”

:sd[The Band plays “Gonna Fly Now while forming a union suit].

Walking back up College Hill, we take a look at Thayer Street and all the swell things you can do there. You can go to the Nuts and Stereo Shop, the Cheese and Stereo Shop, and McDonald’s and HiFi. You can do the IHOP down to Store 18. You can place your precious jewels in Hospital Truss. East Side Reproduction is open in the evening if you want to copy late. And remember that Baskin Robbins comes in 31 flavors. And at last, for those of you who are desperate, there’s the SciLi.

:sd[The band plays the opening fanfare of “Gonna Fly Now.” Barry Fagin ends it all with reams of computer paper trailing behind him. He hits terra firma and expires. We try to return him but he’s overdue.]

The Band now plays “Mash.”

All Kingston aside,... there are good things about Rhode Island.

:::script-list

- RI - where the governor’s your pal and the mayor’s your Buddy.
- RI - where crime is organized but the government isn’t.
- RI - where even the most harmful sewage is kept at bay.
- RI - where America’s cup is held.
- RI - other states have weather. We have rain.

The band forms the one item of protection that no Brown student should be without and plays “The Thunderer.”

:sd[The band forms a condom-like column which soon turns into an umbrella].

Be back next year when the Band remembers URI’s most entertaining halftime show ever. :sd[The URI band did not play because of the strike].
