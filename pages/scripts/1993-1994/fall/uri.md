## Pregame:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is celebrating its 69th anniversary, it's the Brown University "why yes, these are new uniforms we're wearing" BAND!!!

:sd[Band takes the field in a fit of 69th anniversary jubilation.]

## Halftime:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that was NOT humiliated by North Carolina on national TV last April, it's the Brown University "where is Kingston, anyway?" BAND!!!

:sd[Band meanders onto field studying maps of Rhode Island.]

Students returned to College Hill this semester to find a number of changes around campus. French fries at Josiah's doubled in price to 30 cents an ounce, apparently in an effort to jump start the faltering Campaign for the Rising Generation. Police and Security announced a zero tolerance fire alarm policy with fines starting at $10 for students living in buildings where false alarms are pulled, also apparently an effort to jump start the Capital Campaign. Finally, the Ratty implemented a new boxless cereal distribution system, causing a drop in applications to URI and a drop in campus literacy in general.

Watch now as the band forms a cereal box and plays "Lucky's Gone."

Another year, another Governor's Cup. We are happy to see Governor Sundlun here today enjoying the game. On a related note, we'd like to remind the Governor that Bruno the Brown Bear is NOT a raccoon. State Representative and potential gubernatorial challenger Ron Machtley was quoted as saying, "Boy I hope the governor doesn't kill me - in the election that is." And Rhody the Ram, the CCRI mascot, said, "I hope after today's game I'm not Rhody the Rhode Kill."

Watch now as the band forms a raccoon and plays "Bagged Seven."

Today's game is being broadcast by WBRU-AM, so those of you living on the second floor of Emery near the stairway feel free to tune in. In national news, President Clinton and Bill announced their new health care initiative to the nation recently. Harvard Law reported a subsequent rise in applications from former PLME's. The North American Free Trade Agreement will be debated in Congress soon, with the main issue being the possible loss of low skilled American jobs. Professors at URI are already polishing their resumes. Ross Perot says, "That NAFTA agreement makes me so angry I could shoot a raccoon."

Watch now as the Band forms Ross Perot's head and plays "Nothing's In There."

:sd[Band forms Ross Perot's ears with big empty space in between and plays Brown Bear.]

We'll see you again next week when Brown and Bucknell do battle and the band goes raccoon hunting.
