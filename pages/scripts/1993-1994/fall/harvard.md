Coming this winter on Sundays on the Fox Network, it’s the brand new Beavis, Butthead, and Barney Show. Here are some highlights from the season premiere:

:sd[Band plays Barney theme. Announcer interrupts.]

:sd[Butthead voice]

Hey Beavis - this song sucks. Change it. Heh-heh, heh-heh.

:sd[Barney voice]

Hello to all my special friends, I’m glad you came to play.

Our fun and learning never ends, here’s what we did today!

:sd[Butthead voice]

Hey Beavis - look - it’s a big purple and green zit. Heh-heh, heh-heh. (Beavis voice) You said zit. Heh-heh, heh-heh. Let’s burn it. Heh-heh, heh-heh. Fire, fire, fire, fire. . .

:sd[Band forms Barney and plays Fire.]

Also on Fox this winter, tune in for the new “Politically Incorrect Harvard Professors Show.” The premiere will feature Law Professor Alan Dershowitz explaining at length how to make big bucks defending rapists by discrediting their victims. Later shows will include a special on homosexuality, where Government Professor Harvey Mansfield will explain how gays are really unhappy, shameful, and irresponsible. Each show will have a special rebuttal section hosted by film director and Harvard Professor Spike Lee.

Watch now as the Band forms a Spike Lee joint and plays “Jungle Fever”.

In order to expand its curriculum to meet the ever-changing needs of its academic community, Harvard University has recently opened a new shopping mall in Harvard Square. The mall, officially called The Harvard Institute for Mall Studies, will be the home of numerous academic programs. The Psychology Department is offering a new class entitled “Mom, Can I Have Some Money: The Psychology of Mall Rats.” Harvard Business School will naturally make use of the Mall’s many resources to better train its students. And the History Department will be offering a graduate seminar on the History of Malls in America.

Watch now as the Band shows you the real meaning behind Harvard’s new mall and plays “Harvard Mall is Born.”

:sd[Band forms a dollar sign and plays Brown Man Born.]

We’ll see you again in two weeks for the game that will decide it all.
