## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that thrives on adversity, it’s the Brown University - go ahead, boo us, taunt us, jeer at us, curse at us, we dare you - BAND!!!

:sd[Band takes field and quickly regrets its words.]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that watches too much Saturday Night Live, it’s the Brown University - Soylent Green is Sheep! It’s Sheep! BAAAAAAAH! - BAND!!

:sd[Band takes field and begins grazing.]

While writing this week’s show, we were trying to decide whether to do cow jokes or sheep jokes. We decided we could really do either/or, because you do either/or. But we decided to do an entire show of sheep jokes. What do the following four people have in common: Ba Ba Blacksheep, Mary, Little Bo Peep, and Little Boy Blue? Besides the obvious fact that they’re all Dartmouth alums, they’re now all employed in Dartmouth’s Job Placement Office. US New & World Report rates Dartmouth College #1 in the nation for its Shepherding Department.

Watch now as the Band forms what you expect us to form and plays "Ram Tough."

And now for some more sheep jokes. First we’d like to warn all Dartmouth students that wool shrinks when it gets wet. Or in other words, wool causes shrinkage. So be careful with your sheepskins. Speaking of sheep, we thought we should let you know that your ugly, slobbering, sheep-like mascot is good for one thing and one thing only, and it ain’t lamb chops. If you think your mascot intimidates opponents, then someone is pulling the wool over your eyes.

Watch now as the Band forms the Dartmouth Dog and plays "Wool Pajama."

Ah what a beautiful day it is here in Hanover, New Hampshire. The sun is shining, the sheep are grazing on the Big Green Lawn, and the freshmen are contemplating attacking us. New Hampshire is such a pleasant state, especially during shearing season when love is in the air. Such romantic settings are hard to come by in the urban sprawl of Providence. But in Hanover, with its abundant grazing land, love is as common as the contented ba-ah of a sheep on a summer day.

Watch now as the Band forms yet another sheep - this month’s Dartmouth Review "Centerfold."

That’s it for this week’s show. I bet you didn’t think we could make so many sheep jokes. We’ll see you again in two years, when we’ll have ten minutes of cow jokes.
