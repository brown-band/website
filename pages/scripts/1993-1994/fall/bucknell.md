Welcome to Brown University’s annual Parents Weekend. Following is a schedule of activities for students, parents, and guests:

- Immediately following today’s fierce football battle, there will be a tailgate party in the parking lot featuring the magic of David Copperfield as he makes the entire Bucknell Band disappear. Whoops - looks like David cast his spell too soon.
- At 6:00 in Sayles Hall there will be a dinner discussion headed by Dean Bechtel of Psych. Services entitled "The Capital Campaign and You: Why You Should Give More."
- At 8:00 please come to the newly renovated Stuart Theatre where Providence Mayor and world renowned cymbalist Buddy Cianci and Brown President Vartan Gregorian will perform a moving two-person interpretation of the musical South Pacific.

Watch now as the Band engages in happy talky talk and plays "Buy Dusky Right Now."

:sd[Band forms a palm tree and plays Right Here, Right Now.]

Brown parents can often feel out of touch with their children, and sometimes communication between Brown students and their parents is difficult. We’d like to provide parents with the following advice on how to understand what your Brown student is telling you:

- If your student spends time at the Underground, that’s OK. If your student spends time at underground tunnel parties, you should be somewhat concerned.
- If your student studies in the CIT or the Rock, that’s OK. If your student sits in The Gate and plays with rocks, you’ve got a problem.
- If your student has classes during B and H hours, that’s OK. If your student has classes in B&H, that’s still OK. But if your students reads the BDH, you should seek help.
- Watch now as the Band forms a page from the nation’s fifth oldest college newspaper and plays "Recycle It, Man!"

:sd[Band forms a newspaper page and plays Birdland.]

Parents worried about the safety of their child should rest assured that Brown has numerous programs geared toward safeguarding the well-being of its students. The Brown Escort Service is not only free, but takes extra steps to guarantee your student the best protection possible. The same applies to Health Services. Brown Police Officers, though armed only with a smile and a donut, maintain a visible presence on campus, deterring would-be criminals and marauding Harvard students. In fact the Brown campus is so safe that a recent Office of Risk Management study concluded that the only real threats to student’s well-being are UFS theme nights. Watch now as the Band forms a karaoke machine and plays "Burn the Ratty to the Ground."

We’ll see you again in two weeks when Brown and Cornell collide, and the Band implodes.
