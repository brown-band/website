## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization composed entirely of unemployed former Solid Gold dancers, it’s the Brown University - hot pants should be banned - BAND!!!!

:sd[Field takes band.]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is about to act out page 217 of its autobiography, it’s the Brown University - let’s hope the next 217 are as good as the first 217 were - BAND!!!!

:sd[Band takes field back.]

We in the Band always look forward to returning to beautiful Franklin Field. Look’s like the stadium is only about half full today - apparently you’re saving the other half of the seats for the 50% of the Penn applicants who AREN’T accepted. The University of Pennsylvania - heads you’re in, tails you’re waitlisted. Instead of an application fee, Penn applicants can simply mail in five proof-of-purchases from Quaker Oats cereals. Wilford Brimley says, "Apply to Penn. It’s the right thing to do and the tasty way to do it."

Watch now as the Band forms a steaming bowl of oatmeal and plays "Oatmeal for Me."

Autobiography of Elrod T. Snidley, page 217. I have just completed my Penn application and my fifth bowl of Quaker Oats. Although I am nervous about being accepted to Penn, I am enclosing a double-headed quarter to aid the Admissions Office with their final decision. And if that doesn’t work, then I can always bribe someone. I should have no trouble getting in however, because unlike most Penn applicants, I was able to check the "can tie own shoes" box on my application.

Watch now as the Band forms a water buffalo and plays "Penn State Rejection."

Welcome to the University of Pennsylvania’s annual Parent’s Weekend. We’d like to reassure those parents worried about their safety while on campus that, despite Philadelphia’s reputation, the chances of being mugged are no greater than the chances of being attacked by a water buffalo. Furthermore, the University has formed a special Committee for Water Buffalo Safety to increase campus water buffalo safety awareness. Besides, most of the dangerous water buffalo have left Philadelphia and now live in Washington at the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Watch now as the band salutes the City of Brotherly Love and plays "YMCA."

:sd[Band forms the Liberty Bell and plays YMCA.]

We’ll see you again in two years, when the defending Ivy League Champion Brown Bears will pummel the Fighting Quakers into submission.
