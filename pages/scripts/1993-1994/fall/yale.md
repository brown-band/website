## Pregame:

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is about to decisively prove its superior fashion sense, it's the Brown University - anyone wanna buy a used rugby? - Band.

:sd[Band struts onto field, making sure to do our best supermodel imitations.]

## Halftime:

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that feels safe to walk upon its own city streets, it's the Brown University - we get to leave after the game - Band.

:sd[Band warily takes field, checking over their shoulders and making sure to walk in groups of 3 or more.]

As many of you may have heard, the highly respected National Review College Guide recently rated Brown as being at 'the forefront of the dissolution of academic standards'. Other schools such as Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and Dartmouth were also listed as being representative of the 'deplorable state of higher education in America today.' Well, yet another college review that puts Yale second. At Brown we wear Bill Buckley's scorn like a badge of honor. And as for all the faithful readers who rely on the National Review for their college decisions, we heard they're both going to Providence College.

Watch now as the Band forms its GPA and plays 'Liar'.

:sd[Band forms the letters 'N/A' and plays Fire.]

Ah New Haven. If there's one thing we sure do envy about Yale, it's your prime location. The job market here is incredible! You Yalies are almost assured of finding jobs after graduation, what with the World Wrestling Federation headquartered so close by. And men, don't think this doesn't apply to you too! Unfortunately, it seems that the real estate market here is somewhat depressed. Apparently a large institution of higher education, frequently ranked second in the nation, has been selling off its property and inundating the market. In fact, we noticed that the roadside rest stop was offering a special package: get a piece of the Berlin Wall and a piece of Yale for just $5. Needless to say we spent our money on fries instead.

Watch now as Brown flushes the Yale Bowl and plays 'Oh man - what a hole'.

:sd[Brown does a moving formation of a toilet bowl being flushed and plays Old Time Rock and Roll.]

We in the Brown Band would like to be the first to congratulate Yale on their selection of a new President. In order to be certain the President would not jump ship when a better offer came along, the search committee had to make sure that their candidate wasn't qualified for any higher paying jobs. As a service to the search committee, we've compiled a list of the top 5 jobs for which Yale President's are qualified.

:sd[Drum roll please.]

:::script-list

- 5. Salesperson at the Coop in Harvard Square
- 4. Head speechwriter for Joe Biden
- 3. Professor of Hotel Administration at Cornell
- 2. President of the Yale Band
- ...and the number one job for which Yale President's are qualified:
- 1. "Would you like fries with that?"

Watch now as the Band forms the future of all Yalies and plays New Haven Nevermore.

:sd[Band forms the Golden Arches and plays Brown Forevermore.]

We'll see you in two years, by which time we'll really be ready to use the Yale Bowl again.
