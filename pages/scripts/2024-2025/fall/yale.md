## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that will stay off the streets after 8PM, it's the Brown University "Dude, where's my sax?" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We're always glad to go straight to Yale! After all, where else will we practice our golf swing? Go long, or whatever! (Pause) Whoops, sorry 'bout that! Well, when the injury lawsuit rolls in, we know Yale's three Supreme Court justices have our backs. Another victory for the American legal system!

Watch now as the band overshoots the green and plays "FORE!"

:sd[Band forms a B and plays #4.]

Catch us at halftime when we beat the charges.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves home furniture, it's the Brown University "maybe don't sit on THAT couch" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

New Haven. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. Luckily, a benevolent policeman gave us this nifty survival guide. Let’s see here . . . musical instrument thefts are up 69%? No way! We’d better be careful. We thought we got away with that one!

Watch now as the band steals your leaves and handles and plays "Smooth Getaway"

:sd[Band forms a saxophone and plays "Smooth."]

This paragraph previously contained misinformation concerning the existence of a supposed Yale society called Skull and Bones. No such society exists, nor, if it existed, would it be run by Handsome Dan. Please report any rumors of Skull and Bones' existence to the proper authorities.

Watch now as the band forms the emblem Skull and Bones would not have if it existed, which it doesn't, and plays "Nothing's Wrong Song"

:sd[Band forms a bone (penis) and plays Ding Dong Song]

Yale alumni go on to do many things, but the most amazing ones are the ones who give back. Yale graduates teach around the world, and we just wanted to highlight those who are promoting knowledge in leading universities:

- C. Andrew M Gleason, Professor at Harvard University
- D. Howard Koh, Professor at Harvard University

Spin your head at all this greatness, and watch now as the band plays "Ivy Wonderland"

:sd[Band flushes the Yale Bowl and plays Boogie Wonderland.]

We'll connect YOUR cut. Brown Band Out.
