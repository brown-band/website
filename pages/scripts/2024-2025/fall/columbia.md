## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is still really upset about the gentrification of Jo's, it’s the Brown University "it's officially Greg now" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Lots has changed over the past four years, so we are taking it upon ourselves to pass down all our best memories and traditions.

We went on trips without a care, No babysitters anywhere. Bandquet at the Marriot Penn bagels and Stacy’s Mom (aside: for real!) Freshmen on the board? Nah, that’s not how it used to be, Providence tree lighting, Ratty scallops, oh, we’ll see. Rugby flute, we still had Dorle. Cornell river, WHERE IS CARL?

Watch now as the Band honors Athletics timeless old logo and plays "Back In our Day…"

:sd[Band forms B and plays In the Fray]

We didn’t start the fire, but it’lll still be burning once we'e gone

Catch us at halftime when we honor each of our senior bandies and the good times we had with them.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s feeling real weak in the knees, it's the Brown University "21 is the new 65" BANNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.

Jokes about Columbia are as overdone as New York City as a vacation spot (we get it, I’m sure that "tiny niche thrift spot" in the East Village was amazing for you and the 50 other Brown lstudents who went there over the long weekend). So instead, we wanted to take this time to honor our amazing senior musicians, the only way we know how. In verse:

:sd[Band forms a champagne flute and plays bits and pieces]

There once was a Middletown son\
Who gets his earlobe touched for fun\
Rehearsal he'll never miss\
But he won't answer this:\
"What happened to China Star 1?"\

A lad born in 2003\
Who wrestled and practiced tai chi\
A real Indy Jones\
Always digging for bones\
Percussion's most climbable tree\

The only adult in the room\
Her roll-offs are always in tune\
When things are in doubt\
Takes her resume out\
And we hate to have lost her so soon\

A midwestern princess at heart\
Who always has love for the arts\
She spilled milk on her computer,\
Is hockey’s biggest rooter,\
The Band’s favorite sax from the start\

There once was an Orgo TA\
Geeked up playing xbox all day\
From the depths of Cohasset\
A chem test, he'll pass it\
But you know he'll complain the whole way\

There once was a singer from Joisey\
He's always the best type of noisy\
Has costumes galore\
For Broadway and more\
You know that his skin's never oily\

Is anyone more ever true\
Than the ex-prez from old '22?\
An angel from heaven\
(Or CS11)\
She keeps spirits high, never blue\

A man who would never eat cheeses\
Knows all of Swift’s musical pieces\
We'd finish this rhyme\
But we ran out of time\
He has to go work on his thesis\

There once was a Gurthy webmaster\
Who couldn't get to manic Monday faster\
A bathlete, he throw\
And plays the oboe\
Our favorite alumni broadcaster\

There was a wee Freshman from Blair\
Who waved his hands all through the air\
Conducts when we play,\
Keeps his hopes up each day,\
Let's hope he won't tear out his hair\

Though his first love is jazz, we'll say\
We always cheer to see DJ!\
Has many creations\
Check out his animations!\
And loud on the trumpet he'll play\

On quads and on bass, he keeps steady\
He's never behind or ahead-y\
Whenever he shows\
He keeps on his toes\
For a comeback he always is ready\

In band, he's the eepiest lad\
And he rarely shows up; What a cad!\
But his heart's never evil\
He's our favorite weevil\
So whenever he's here, we're all glad\

Thank you for all the time and memories you've given us. We hope you all have a great time in the retirement home (or Boston) as you join the real world. We know there's great thing to come for you all.

Remember, there's always consulting! Brown Band Out.
