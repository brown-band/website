## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that IS commenting on Cornell, Ithaca, their athletics department, and their request for our script to be approved, it's the Brown University "wails horribly and pretends to die" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Throughout our adventures, we've gotten to know the city of Ithaca quite well. The weather there's so terrible, a certain Mr. Maslow dropped out – I guess modern civilization was high on his hierarchy of needs. Meanwhile, the competing Cornell hierarchy reads as follows: "Corn."

Watch now as the band self-actualizes and plays "So, Tell Me About Your Mom."

:sd[Band forms a question mark and plays Stacy's Mom.]

Whew! We really pulled off that song, and thanks to some recent changes in noise ordinances, no one can stop us! Let's celebrate with a toast at Cornell's wine tasting class–just don't have too much, or the psychology department will extract your brain for its collection. They've got over a hundred brains in there, which is more than the entire Cornell student body.

Watch now as the band shows how many brains WE have and plays "One."

:sd[Band forms B and plays #1.]

Catch us at halftime when we admire a paved road.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization whose mothers are surely proud of us, it's the Brown University "stuff Wii Theme again" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

To all the Brunonian families here this weekend, we'd like to extend a warm welcome, one as warm and bright as Big Red! Fun fact: The red color of Cornell is inspired by the flags you get while dating Cornell students, and the white is inspired by the parents' faces when they walk into the wrong store in the commons. Still not sure what the bear is for, though. What kind of school has a bear as its mascot?

Watch now as the Band falls and cries and plays the Dirge.

Hey, ya like Huey Lewis and the News? Well here's some news for ya: Huey, among others, are so lucky as to be able to call themselves Cornellians. Some of the other notable alumni include:

:::script-list

- A. Henry Heimlich, who helps out when Big Red chokes
- B. E.B. White—Hey, what's that web say? "SOME BEAR"?
- C. Kurt Vonnegut, who named his most famous novel after his dorm
- D. Thomas Midgley, best known for destroying the ozone layer
- E. BILL! BILL! BILL! BILL! and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band salutes Cornell Crusties through the ages and plays "Time Warp".

ROOOOOOOM SERVICE! Brown Band Out.
