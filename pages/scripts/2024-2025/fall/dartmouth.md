## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting the fifth horseman of the apocalypse, it's the Brown University "voices crying out in the wilderness" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Do you hear the trumpets blaring? We do, unfortunately. A message comes from He Who Knows The Places You Shall Go to The One Who Pens The World's End. From within the house of beasts "Alpha Delta Phi" there will arise a herald, and the world will be coated in ice. I'’s time . . . for snowballs.

Watch now as the band fights ice with fire and plays "We'll Fire YOUR Flames."

:sd[Band forms an icicle (penis) and plays Through the Fire and the Flames]

Whew! Glad that's over. All the excitement around here can really rock a fella–it's enough to give you a heart attack! This is what a college is supposed to look like, Ike? Well, we might have our differences, but Brown and Dartmouth do both love their Greens!

Watch now as the band tries its best.

:sd[Band forms their favorite form and plays their favorite song.]

What does Dartmouth do, in the end? Brown Band Out.
