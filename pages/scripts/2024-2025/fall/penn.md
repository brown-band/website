## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that knows when Halloween REALLY is, it's the Brown University "Spooky Scary Skeletons" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Did you know? Penn hosts the largest and oldest track and field event in the United States. This is because once you get into Penn, all you want to do is run. To encourage runners, coaches traditionally shout things that terrify Penn students, like "Trickle-down economics is a flawed system!" and "UPenn? Is that a state school?"

Watch now as the band catches up to speed and plays "Pretty Fast"

:sd[Band forms a P and plays Pretty Fly.]

After this game, you might want to get out quick. We've heard rumors about Penn students trying to bring back the Rowbottom riots! Brick up your windows! Make sure your underwear's not over there! And keep the fire brigade on call, especially if you're taking the trolley back home.

Watch now as the band goes off the rails and plays "Brown Steering Song."

:sd[Band forms a B and plays #2.]

Catch us at halftime when the band gets back on track.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that had to try really hard not to mention some of your alumni, it's the Brown University "Maybe graduating a president is overrated after all" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

At Brown University, you'll always crush your schoolwork, but at UPenn, schoolwork crushes you! What's that? It's the wrong country for a Russian reversal? But the only thing colder than the Motherland's winters is the heart of a Penn student! They're more green than red, though.

Break out the hammer and sickle and watch now as the band plays "Wa, Wa, Wharton."

:sd[Band forms a hammer and plays "Rasputin."]
