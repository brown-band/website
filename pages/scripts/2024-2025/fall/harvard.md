## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's here 200 strong, it's the Brown University "who needs those ten thousand men of Harvard, anyway?" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

It's an exciting day today - we get to welcome the Harvard band to Brown! (Pause) Harvard? Harvard? HAAAARVAAAARD! (Pause). Huh, looks like they aren't here. I wonder how that could've happened. Maybe they got lost on I-95? Nah, they'd have to find it first. Maybe they couldn't get their moms to sign their permission slips? Nah, they could've just copied the signatures. Maybe they went broke after falling below Babson on the Wall Street rankings? Nah, they're always bragging about how big their budget is. Eh, we'll figure it out. For now, watch as the band cheers itself up and plays "We Should Get in Touch."

Wait a minuteâ€“I got it! Harvard Band must be envious of an organization that's 100 years old! Don't miss halftime and an appearance by the one and only Big Brown Centennial Band!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, let's start at the beginning . . . the very, very beginning. Long ago, there was nothing. And then, out of the darkness, there emerged the Brown University Band.

:sd[Band swirls into a 100]

Back in this long-forgotten time, waaay back in 1924, when you couldn't get a Bruno Brew at a Brown football game, Irving Harris founded the Band. With just a broom and a dream, Harris, who was just a wee freshman at the time, brought joy to Brown University right in time for the Great Depression.

Watch now as the band performs the same song it has played for 100 years, and parties like it's 1924!

By the 1970's, the band was well on its way to becoming the world's greatest musical ensemble. But one thing stood in the way . . . Harvard's bass drum, Big Bertha. November 15, 1973. Four courageous Brown men head north and convince two Cantabrigians to load the big drum into their vehicle. With the drum firmly in their possession, the brave charlatans of Brunonia hit the road. And if it wasn't for those meddling Massachusetts state policemen, they would have gotten away with it! But the real question is, why did the Harvard Band call the police after they loaded THEIR bass drum onto OUR truck?

Watch now as the Band is legally restrained from being near the Harvard bass drum and plays "Bruno B. Bad"

By 1988, the Band had set its sights on the world's highest office: The Presidency [pause] of the Undergraduate Council of Students. Naturally, we had to put forward the candidate who best represents our values and aspirations, our mascot Elrod T. Snidley. Here's why we believe Snidley deserves your vote:

:::script-list

- A. He'll never talk back
- B. He can bench more than Bruno
- C. He looks dashing in his boater
- D. He negotiated a Brown-Harvard peace treaty
- E. "He won't do diddly!" and
- F. The Princeton band

Join us on the campaign trail as Elrod goes on to win 51% of the vote as a write-in candidate and the band plays "Time Warp to the Polls"

We've finally made it back to the modern day, and back to the Athletics Department, this time as a club sport and the university's greatest athletic supporters. We're athletes! We're musicians! We're the university's greatest athletic supporters!

Seriously, it's been a great 100 years playing for you, Brown University, and we're looking forward to 100 more. Ever truly yours, the Brown Band.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Ever True.]

Join us again next week, when the Bears take on the Bryant Bulldogs and the Band answers the question, "Did we really recruit that many freshmen this year?!" Brown Band Out.
