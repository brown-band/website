## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that hasn't worn hats since the Cold War, it's the Brown University "We should've gone to New York City" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

So, where are we again? _Gasp_ A football game?! How ungentlemanly! All of you, get out of the stadium this instant and go jump in the lake! Andrew Carnegie personally financed this artificial lake so that you all would take up rowing, not run around clutching balls like a pack of guttersnipes! You can always trust Princeton-made watercraft!

Watch now as the band powders their wigs and plays "Sirs and Dukes."

:sd[Band forms a boat and plays Sir Duke.]

Catch us at halftime when the Band chases its own tail.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that hasn't washed its hands in 10 years, it's the Brown University "what happens in Princeton stays in Princeton" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Sun Tzu once said "Every battle is won before it is fought." Well, we've followed his advice and painstakingly researched all of Princeton's sports teams to concoct a masterful strategy! According to a briefly skimmed Wikipedia article, Princeton's basketball team is the best known in the Ivy League (citation needed). Wonder how they've been doing lately?

Watch now as the band fakes right to break left and plays "Ball Don't Lie."

:sd[Band forms a B and plays "Hips Don't Lie".]

People tend to think of Princeton students as a bunch of puffed-up egotists in their ivory towers (pause). They've done a lot for you! Here's a list of all the great things we wouldn't have without Princeton's inventors:

:::script-list

- A. The atomic bomb (Pause) Okay, bad start
- B. The Bombe (no, the other one)
- C. The Turing machineâ€“you know, the machine that tures things
- D. The game of life (no, the other one)
- E. The Cox-Zucker machine (Pregnant pause) and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band drops the bomb and plays "Joshua Robert Oppenheimer"

:sd[Band forms a rocket and plays Joshua.]

Give our sweater back. Brown Band Out.
