Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization from literally 1984, it’s the Brown University “so how’s Czechoslovakia doing?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Recently we’ve been feeling nostalgic for a different time. A simpler time. And that’s why we’ve decided to tear down that spatio-temporal wall and skate our way back to the 1980s! What isn’t there to love about this bodacious decade? I mean, there’s all the best music, arcades on every corner, the constant threat of nuclear warfare, JORTS?? . . . Okay, let’s take a chill pill. Cowabunga!

Watch now as the band gets totally tubular and plays “Funky Jorts.”

:sd[Band forms “jorts” and plays Any Way You Want It.]

Starting today, the Brown Band is initiating a harsh crackdown: we have too many acapella groups! If someone asks you to join a group, just say no! We call this campaign the Brown Acapella Resistance Education program–B.A.R.E. for short. Join us today and memorize all of our catchy, yet ultimately ineffectual slogans!

Watch now as the band takes a bite out of crime and plays “Rock Mobster.”

:sd[Band forms “bag of bones” and plays Beat It.]

[Doc Brown voice] Great Scott! Our DeLorean’s almost out of gas! In order to generate the 1.21 jiggawatts of power we need to get home, we’ll have to skate faster than eighty-eight miles per hour. But first, we’ve gotta write a quick letter . . . “Dear Dorle: On the night that we go back in time, you will be kidnapped by Yalies. Please don’t take any precautions, and stay right where you are.”

Watch now as the band goes back to the future and plays “Back in My Fray!”

:sd[Band counterskates into a B and plays In The Fray.]

You might not have been ready for this ice show, but your kids are gonna love it! Brown Band Out.
