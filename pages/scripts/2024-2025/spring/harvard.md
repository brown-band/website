Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization with a family tree so tangled it’s practically a Bush, it’s the Brown University “Now watch this drive” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

In this world, nothing can be said to be certain except three things: Death, taxes, and the fact that even after 100 years apart, Brown Band alumni are always ready to come together! We’re one, big happy family–and like any family, we’ve got our traditions, our rituals, and our sacred practices. Don’t worry about the strange noises coming from the band closet!

Watch now as the band enters a Dionysian frenzy and plays “The Obsession That I Get.”

This show goes out to all our crusties, but it’s also for all our soon-to-be crusties! We’re sure that 100 years from now, our seniors will be pushing their old, decrepit bodies onto the ice for our 200th-anniversary game, and they’ll be just as graceful and acrobatic as they are now. Just because you need a walker to get around doesn’t mean you can’t get around!

Watch now as the band pulls off some sick tricks and plays “Schmoove.”

:sd[Band forms “skateboard” and plays “Smooth”.]

After 100 years of performing for you all, we have a confession to make: we have not been entirely honest with you. Just as the statue of John Harvard has its three lies, we, too, have told five lies that we intend to confess here:

:::script-list

- A. The Harvard Bass we returned was a highly detailed forgery
- B. We lost track of our calendar during Y2K, so the band is actually 99 years old
- C. The alumni couldn’t make it; these are paid actors
- D. Brown is not actually in Rhode Island
- E. The Brown Band did nothing at all in Dallas, Texas in 1963 And
- F. The Princeton Band!

Watch now as the band uses up a century of material and plays “I’m A-Frayed We’re Out Of Ideas.”

:sd[Band forms a B and plays In the Fray.]

We’ll be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened in this show! Brown Band Out.
