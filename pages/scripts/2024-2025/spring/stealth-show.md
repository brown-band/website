Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization of skibidi rizzlers trying to goon in Ohio, it’s the Brown University “I’ll Mello in YOUR Phone” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Did you know? Bruno wasn’t always the Brown mascot. It used to be a large bird of prey, but then it went from a hawk to a bear. We had to switch around 25 years ago, after the hawk went missing during a trip to Princeton. Who knows where it flew off to when we stopped in Manhattan? But we’ll always remember him.

Watch now as the band forms X and plays We Want Him Back.

What truly is a band? What is music? Where are we? Let’s try and figure it out. Possibilities include:

:::script-list

- A. Three Perkins rats in a trench coat
- B. An important pillar of the Rhode Island wine and spirits industry
- C. One big happy family–you know, like the Habsburgs!
- D. The second coming of John D. Rockefeller Jr.
- E. _*E*_
- F. The Princeton Band!

Watch now as the band questions reality and plays “Am I the Real Monster?”

Nos pages d’Instagram sommes etre tres êtrange recement. Nos rouleaux sont remplis de pastèques, de chiens volants et du pingouin des backyardigans. Il s'avère cependant qu'il y a des avantages. Si vous parlez dans une langue que personne ne comprend, personne ne saura que vous parlez de “m-preg.” C’est formidable.

Regardez maintenant comment le band le bat.
