## Pregame

Enter from the “pine tree” entrance on 2 choruses of “Ever True” then short immediate roll-off into “Victory March” flank between choruses of same to Dartmouth.

While standing to Dartmouth play “While the backs go tearing by”.

About face and on the trio of “BBB” form the Van Wickle Gate.

Play “Brown Man Born” and then “Star Spangled Banner” and off.

## Halftime

We were to have come on the field on Fire-engines. Due to the goof-up, we improvised the entrance from the pine-trees, marched the band down the track, formed the two lines and played the fanfare and took off.

Formed a Key in the middle of the field (While playing “Hutchinson Field”) announced the Key gift.

Roll-off into “Victory March” and formed “# 50” and announced the class of 50 gift.

Played “Victory March” and formed “$” and played “The Best Things in Life Are Free”.

Reblocked and on “Ever True” faced the Brown stands. Played the Alma Mater.
