## Pregame

::script-note[Pre-game same as ever, except the the band was to have formed two lines to run the team through. Due to the timing of the drill teams, however, that part of the stunt was cancelled.]

## Halftime

:sd[Band marks time while announcer says]

Our topic today is astronomy, or the study of heavenly bodies. We think this is appropriate for homecoming. In the language of the scandal magazines, we’re going to take the lid off the Hayden Planetarium. Ladies and Gentlemen, The Brown University Band.

:sd[Band Steps Off] :sd[When Band Stops, Announcer Says]

Very appropriate, men. that looks like Cassiopetia, The Dame on the Divan, The Lady on the Chaise Lounge, The Babe on The Bench. What’s next?

:sd[Band fragments. When band is spread out announcer says]

Ah! Now we’re really scanning the skies. Let’s see if I can pick out a few of these consteliations for you. What are you guys supposed to be? Oh — the milky way. I see. And that must be saturn over there on tle thirty with its seven rings. :sd[Cheer leaders run through] Blasted comets — they’re thick as flies these days. Tell me, what has this got to do with the Brown-Cornell game? Oh, I see. on the forty-five yard line are Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, the big and little bears. The north star should be in there somewhere — would the north star raise his hand? :sd[he does] TWINKLE-twinkle, Charlie. :sd[Charlie Waves back] And look at that crazy spiral nebulae. :sd[band moves toward center of field] Fellows, the universe is supposed to be expanding, not contracting. Oh… this is going to be a close-up… a real celestial body. Ladies and gentlemen, the Brown Band takes pleasure in presenting **The Brown Key**!

::script-note[The end of the show was the Key's presentation of the queens, the poster awards, and the Alma Mater. The old car parade was partly effective for the queen's entry.]
