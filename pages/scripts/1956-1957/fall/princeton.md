::script-note[Pre-game same as before.]

Enter from the “pine tree” entrance on 2 choruses of “Ever True” then short immediate roll-off into “Victory March” flank between choruses of same to Princeton.

While standing to Princeton play “While the backs go tearing by”.

About face and on the trio of “BBB” form the Van Wickle Gate.

Play “Brown Man Born” and then “Star Spangled Banner” and off.

## Halftime

:sd[Band marks time while announcer reads:]

This is the age of bigger and better. Automobiles have grown so long one can barely park them. Movies, while they may not be better than ever, are certainly bigger than ever. The Brown University Band has long advocated small-screen half times shows, but progress is progress. The Band today proposes to stretch the football field out beyond its hundred yards. As a salute to Princeton, the Brown Band will form the largest tiger ever created. Stand back, friends, put on your three-D classes, and away we go.

:sd[Roll-off into BBB and step off after intro. When band has stopped, announcer says:]

And there you have it! A tiger so large the field cannot hold him. His body is directly under the Princeton stands, and his legs extend into the field outside the stadium. Unfortunately, only his tail is visible on the football field. (Now he is shaking tail begins to wag) … and how he paws the earth with his great claws! Too bad all you can see of this is his great tail wagging — but use your imaginations, friends — the :script-tab hold no more.

:sd[Roll-off into “B” then block for Alma Mater.]
