## Pregame

Marched on the field with “Ever True”. Flanked and moved thru the Penn Football team, played the trio of "Thunder Song March" for Penn, about face and Van Wickle gates and “Brown Man Born” and off.

## Halftime

Marched on from Brown's right.

See attached sheet for script. Music used was “BBB” “Victory March”, “Hutchinson Field” to “$” and then thanks to the Penn Brown club with “The Best Things In Life Are Free” block to Brown side and “Alma Mater”.
