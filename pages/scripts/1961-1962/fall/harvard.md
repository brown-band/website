Ladies and Gentlemen, Introducing the Brown University Marching Band, Farrell Fleming - President, Dennis Wyckoff - Drum Major, Martin Fischer - Director.

:sd[March to Mid field on <u>St. Julien</u>]

Today the Brown Band wishes to draw your attention to some of the more serious current events of our day. We take you to the Brandenburg Gate. Listen to the song of several Berliners.

Returning from Germany, we find a new dance craze has swept America.

The band invites the ‘10,000 twisting men of Harvard’ to twist along with the Brown Band,

:sd[Form Bomb]

Finally the Band takes you to its Providence testing grounds where it has constructed the biggest bomb of all. For security reasons the exact figure cannot be formed on the field.

:sd[Explodes into Cloud, then Cloud disperses suddenly everyone freezes]

Don’t worry folks, the Band was not absorded into the atmosphere.
