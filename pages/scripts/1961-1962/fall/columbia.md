:sd[To midfield on Billboard]

Today the Band presents its first annual animal show to introduce the class of 1965 to the animals of Brown.

:sd[Jump into ‘<u>65</u>’]

The first animal in the Band’s spotlight is the pure white lamb symbolizing the innocence of this year’s freshmen.

The next animal is the pig, the guinea pig, who is often seen running the maze between the Psych and Biology Buildings.

Now the Band wishes to salute our sister institution on the south by forming the Roaring Columbia Lion. :sd[Jump into Tail] Unfortunately the lion Is so large that only its tall is visible within the confines of Brown Field.
