## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Baby-kissers and hand-shakers, Presenting an Organization that's already homesick, it's the Brown University "Send Money Now" Band!

:sd[Band runs onto the field]

Aren't they adorable? Six weeks into college and they already look soooo grown up! The baby fat is melting away and turning into an honest to goodness midriff bulge, those sparkly eyes have crows feet, and some even show signs of male pattern baldness. Better love us now - before we turn into old curmudgeons.

:sd[Band Forms Football, Plays "Championship"]

Of course, these signs of premature aging only mean that your precious babies are working their TAILS off to make up for the $100 a day that you're paying to have them here. And since they work so hard, they should get a cut of the spendings....right?

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Parents and Legal Guardians, Presenting "The finest organization ever to enter Brown University," It's the URI - Marching - Band!

:sd[Band semi-marches to the 20, then runs on in some disorganized manner ...]

We know you miss your kids. And of course, you'd like to think that they miss you. But to tell you the truth, they've already forgotten who you are. So quick! Send them money to make them remember! - Or better still send money to us ... we'll pass it on to them; really we will.

But of course, you know they love you for more than your pocketbook! some of your kids even remember where they came from. Watch now as the band remembers its origins, and plays "women from mars."

:sd[Band Forms female symbol O+- , Plays "American Woman"]

Well, now you know where we come from. But where did YOU come from? Here at Brown we represent a number of nationalities. For example, our new vice president comes from Princeton. We're not sure, but we think that Princeton's located somewhere in the sea of tranquility. Other celestial orbs are represented as well. Rumor has it that Dean Desrocher is really from Neptune. And our guest soloist, Richard Price, has a sound so big they can hear it anywhere in the Solar System. Watch now as Richie sends a message home about a place called N'Orleans.

Here on earth, we're all anxiously watching the race for the presidency. As always, family values is a hot topic. It seems that some candidates are calling for a return to the nuclear family - mom, dad, big brother, little sis, and a dog that glows in the dark. But we all know the problem with nuclear power, right? it's unstable! it causes severe mutations! it can drive you craaaazy and even make you....DYSFUNCTIONAL. watch now as the band splits the atom and explodes the family values myth with the help once again of Richard Price.

The band recently heard that The Flu will be arriving 3 weeks early this year - it was able to find discount fares in October. Good thing all you parents are here! Although your kids will have made it clear that they're independent, no one can turn down a nice bowl of chicken soup when you've got the sniffles. Well, Unless they're a vegetarian. Watch now as our temperature rises and we survive anyway, thanks to you, our ever loving families.

:sd[Band Forms Bowl of Soup, Plays "I Will Survive"]

Thank you all for coming out and sharing a little ram meat with your kids on this fine Saturday afternoon. we'd love to see you again next weekend, as we make the quakers....y' know....QUAKE...in beautiful, sophisticated, oh-so- ... je ne sais quoi ... downtown Philadelphia.
