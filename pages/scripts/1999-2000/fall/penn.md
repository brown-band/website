## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that produces more bad jokes than an infinite number of monkeys, it's the Brown University "Schopenhauer, I hardly know her!" Band!

We asked Decartes to help us out with this script - he said "I think not" and disappeared in a poof of smoke. Watch now as the band forms a puff of smoke that looks suspiciously like a football, and plays a Mozart sonata that sounds suspiciously like "Championship."

As you can see (or rather hear) the band is in a constant state of denial. And we don't mean Egypt. Speaking of bodies of water, if when you go into the bathroom you're Russian, when you come out of the bathroom you're American, what are you when you're in the bathroom? (pause) European! (band groans.) Watch as the band forms B for Brown and cheers the team along.

## Halftime

Ladies and Germs, Friends and Alumni, presenting and organization that walked into a bar - :sd[band: "Ouch!"] - it's the Brown University "take my wife; please!" Band!

We just flew in from Providence, and boy are our arms tired. Speaking of flying, what has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck! Speaking of garbage, how about that Penn Band? The Penn band could be the farmer's best friend - just spread them over the fields and watch the corn spring up! Watch now as the band makes hay while the sun shines and plays "Evil Maize."

The beauty of rural Pennsylvania brings to mind the line from "America the Beautiful" about amber waves of grain. But not all of Pennsylvania is an Amish paradise; much of it is a trailer-park heaven. Which begs the question, "Why did the Band cross I-95? To get to the double-wide." Watch now as the band forms a twister and demolishes the Pennsylvania countryside.

I don't think we're in Pennsylvania anymore, Toto. Looks like the brown band is somewhere over the rainbow! Well, there doesn't seem to be anything interesting here. We'd better just go back into our closet (or a bus) and go home. Watch now as the brown band clicks its combat boots together three times and rides back home on another tornado.

Don't look for us at Fordham next week - we don't want to go to the Bronx! We will, however, kick off hockey season against the Crimson Menace, 7pm at Meehan Auditorium.
