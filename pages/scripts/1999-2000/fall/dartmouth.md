## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that's colder than it's ever been (and now it's even colder), it's the Brown University, "What's this flaky white stuff?" Band!

According to the laws of chaos theory, every snowflake is unique in its own, special way. The band is good at being chaotic. If a butterfly flaps its wings in Taiwan, we end up flat on our backs in Providence. Watch now as the band becomes something you've never seen before, or will ever see again...

You may be wondering... what would the future be like right now if we had formed a sheep instead? There's a well known parable about a person - let's say a Brown student - who discovers a time machine. She uses it to go back to the days of the dinosaurs, with strict instructions not to alter anything in any way. She slips, however, and squashes something - say a prehistoric sheep. When she returns to her own time, she discovers that her world is completely changed. The U.S. is a monarchy, apples are oranges... and she goes to Dartmouth! Watch now as the band forms a prehistoric sheep, and plays "Stargrazers."

Too bad there's no snow [or if there's snow, say "Good thing there's snow"]. We could have demonstrated our favorite chaotic principle - the Snowball Effect. No, not "snowballing," you warped people. We're referring to iterations -something that starts small and grows and grows and grows more complicated. Like the Brown football team's defensive strategy. If you're still not sure what we mean, we'll show you.

Thanks for coming all the way to Hanover - we know it's quite an ordeal. We'd be honored if you joined us in sunny, warm, technologically enhanced Providence for the last game of the season against Columbia.
