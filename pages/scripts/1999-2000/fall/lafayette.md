## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that's bigger, badder, and twice as absorbent as when you last saw it, it's the Brown University "Just add water" Band!

:sd[Band runs onto field, forms football.]

The band will be holding a very special contest today - anyone who can correctly identify the hometown of Lafayette will win - that's right - win - their VERY OWN BROWN BAND BUTTON! Isn't that exciting?

:sd[Band plays "Championship"]

To be honest, we're still not convinced that Lafayette even exists - but hey, if they don't exist, then we're bound to win. Watch now as the band forms our favorite letter and plays Brown Forevermore.

:sd[Band forms "B", Plays some stinkin' Brown song....]

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that couldn't find Easton, Pennsylvania if you gave them an atlas, it's the Brown University "Lafayette? isn't that in Oregon?" Band!

:sd[Band crosses the field like the Donner Party]

Last week found the band in Scenic New Haven, where we were able to fill up an entire halftime show with bad jokes about Yale's presidential candidate, George dub-yah. We planned to do the same thing this week, but then we realized that there isn't a presidential candidate from Lafayette. Watch now as the band tries to think of a famous Lafayette alum and plays "Build me up, Buttercup."

:sd[Band forms "?" on field, plays "Build me up..."]

Unable to name anyone from Lafayette, the band turned to the web to continue our research into that mysterious institution. There we were able to learn a great deal about today's opposition. For example, we discovered that Easton was recently named the "Most Excellent" community in Pennsylvania, thus answering an age old question - "What ever happened to Bill and Ted?" Watch now as the band salutes our favourite time travelers from the 80's and their "Bogus Education" by forming a telephone booth and playing "Speak Up Mambo"

:sd[Band forms a , plays "Time Warp"]

Here at Brown, President Gee has recently announced the "Stephen Robert Initiative for the Study of Values," a three-year program to promote a "sustained, focused study and discussion of fundamental human values." It appears that Gee has decided to model the initiative on a similar program already in place at Lafayette, "Values and Science/Technology," or VAST. The Lafayette program, which has been in place for several years, incorporates many of the same components as the Brown initiative would:

:::script-list

- A. a whopping 20 pages of mandatory writing assignments per semester.
- B. special sections for engineers requiring only 10 pages.
- C. an essay competition - last year's winner was titled "10 reasons not to hurt puppies."
- D. required reading from the Book of Mormon.
- E. abstinence.
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band joins the Jain sect and abstains from eating onions:

:sd[Band forms an onion, plays "Green Onions"]

At this point in the show, we'd like to give some advice to the class of '03. Eat at Spikes. Don't feel obliged to tell us all how pornography objectifies the poor lost puppy that you rescued from a Lafayette student while you were doing summer charity work teaching values to inner-city youth. And finally, don't confuse Kinko's and Miko. Both are open 24 hours, but for very different reasons.

&lt;Ahem&gt;

Join us next week for Homecoming when the bears take on the big red :sd[band: "big red what?"], but their band stays home, because they prefer to sit in the VAST wasteland of Ithaca, NY.

:sd[Band forms a "B", plays #In the Fray]
