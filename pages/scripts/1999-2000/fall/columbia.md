## Pregame

:sd[Band forms champagne flute, plays bits and pieces as seniors run through]

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alums\
 Plebes, Bourgoisie, and President Gee\
 children of famous people and bums

please now join the band as we\
 salute our seniors - and to show them we care-a\
 give them a toast with a glass of bubbly

we’ll start with a bang for the end of an era\
 to the top of the glass, this bandie will hasten\
 its cymbal crashing bass drum toting Russian speaking Sara!

:sd[Band plays]

another percussion, this one named Jason\
 with a will to win as strong as a tank\
 and conducting skills that make the women start chasin’

:sd[Band plays]

an ex-band board flutist’s the top of the rank\
 when she’s played piccolo, she’s never been screechy\
 what’s her name? I’m drawing a (Kathy) Blank

her tone sweet’n’low, her temperament peachy\
 she keeps her horn greased, so her slide’s never sticky\
 for the sake of the rhyme, we’ll call her Kate Beechy

:sd[Band plays]

with so few low-toned blowers, we can’t be too picky\
 what we got was in fact our best wishes come true\
 the incredible, fantastic, fabulous Mickey

one sousaphone’s good, but its better with two\
 we’ll miss him next year but we’ll have to suffice\
 let’s all say a fond farewell to Mike Wu

:sd[Band Plays]

Jordan plays bass drum; he’ll try anything twice\
 with the smoothest technique this side of Chuck\
 and he’s good for a laugh when we play on the ice.

:sd[Band Plays]

next Michael Pfeffer, a bandie with pluck\
 he’s played reeds and brass, and twice been VP\
 in Medical school, we all wish him luck!

:sd[Band Plays]

Finally, the last of the bubbles you’ll see\
 after two years as president, he’s earned a vacation\
 for those who can’t guess, it’s Kyle Mitschele

his plans are to teach the history of our nation\
 since he’s off to grad school we bid him farewell\
 and hope all goes well with his Brown Application.

for these nine seniors, our hearts with pride swell\
 nevermore across the football field will they disperse.\
 what wonders they’ll do next only time will tell\
 we hope that they’ve had ample time to rehearse.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization whose favorite smurf was Handy Smurf, it’s the Brown University, "La la la-la la la" ... BAND!

The band spent the past week writing, directing, and producing its own musical: "The Life and Times of Josiah Carberry." Wanting a frenetic, high-energy show, the band tried to recruit Tommy Tune as its choreographer. Unfortunately we had to make due with Professor Morone. We had to give up our dream of opening at the Winter Garden for a slightly smaller space... a broom closet on fifth floor Keeney. Watch now as the band looks for another opening, and gets off off off off off Broadway.

:sd[Band forms star, plays "On Broadway"]

Our protagonist is a young doctor of psychoceramics who comes of age in New York during the era of blackjack and Madame Butterfly. Wait-- forget the blackjack. And New York City. We’ll just call it "Madame Butterfly" and set it in Japan, with Godzilla as the love interest. Mothra will appear in a special role as the spurned lover. Watch now as the show’s one star rating goes up in flames, and the band plays "Starblazers."

Tragically, our hero is killed when Mothra asks him if he is a god, and he says no. The correct answer, of course, is "You bet your sweet patootie I’m a god." Mothra then goes to a final battle with the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man over the streets of Kyoto. Watch now as the band forms B for butterfly and covers the field with sweet, sticky white stuff.

:sd[Band forms B, plays "In the Fray"]

We feel that Mothra, like the Columbia Band, was just misunderstood. All it asked for was a little tender loving care. Speaking of TLC, next week the band will be taking a holiday to go home and eat so much they’ll have to roll us back up College Hill. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!
