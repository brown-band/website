## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that’s living in a broom closet on fifth floor Keeney, it’s the Brown University “How ‘bout that housing lottery?” Band! The band, however, has decided to come out of the closet for our 75th anniversary. We invited the Yale band along, but they’re all being housed in converted bathrooms. And if you think that’s bad, we can tell by the smell that Cornell is housing students in the cowshed again.

We thank you all for coming, and hope that you’re as loud as you were on Thursday night at the pep rally. So strap yourselves in and enjoy the ride as the band forms its favorite letter and plays “I’m a Brown Man Born ”.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization astoundingly spry for its age, it’s the Brown University “You don’t look a day over 75” Band!

:sd[Band hobbles onto the field]

The band is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, and has finally come to appreciate the finer things in life: 8:30 section, parking tickets, and the Ratty Cheese Baked Scrod. To quote the Brown Club of Chicago, “Remember that shivery little 10-piece band we used to take to New Haven? Well the little shivery band has reached the age of long pants and now they’re going to have the BIG BROWN BAND!” Watch now as the band welcomes HOME all the alumni and plays “Sweet Home Providence”

Since the band is celebrating its 75th anniversary, we thought we’d teach the band all about its history. So here’s a simple question: “Little band, who made thee; dost thou know who made thee?”

:sd[Band forms a FIRE, mills around, looks at press box, shrugs ...]

[Whispered : “Irving Harris - Band - Irving Harris”] The band’s answer is ... is ... the band doesn’t seem to have an answer. Watch now as the band turns big red with embarrassment and plays “Fire”

It has recently come to our attention that the band at one point possessed New England’s largest bass drum, an honor that now rests with Harvard. According to a 1925 Brown Daily Herald Article “A corps of drummers, a first string and an assistant drummer, practiced all summer and developed what was considered the smoothest bass drum technique this side of the Jordan.” The band will now use its oversize bass drum and extra-smoooooth technique to bring the walls tumblin’ down.

Speaking of band history, it gives us great pleasure to introduce Mr Warren Leonard, class of 1930 the band’s first student conductor. Mr Leonard will now lead the band in playing a number from its first concert appearance, “S.I.B.A”

Let’s hear it for Mr. Leonard.

Unlike Mr. Leonard, some things just shouldn’t be brought back. The band would like to salute all the things from the 70’s that ought to be left alone, like disco night at the Ratty, “that seventies show”, and Sister Sledge. Watch now as the band shows its favorite year of the 70’s.

The band is saddened that our counterparts from Cornell were unable to appear at today’s game. Their train powered by pure funk broke down, as the Cornell Band is about as funky as the Friendly Fruit Guy. The band will now take a moment to remind you that “plums are firm” and “banana = potassium.” Watch now as the Band forms a B and plays “Brown Pear”

Join us next week as Brown faces off against the “tygers, tygers burning bright” in the forests of Providence, and the band recovers from the 75th anniversary festivities.
