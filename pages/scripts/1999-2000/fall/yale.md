## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that hasn’t used cocaine for at least 25 years, it’s the Brown University “Dice que ‘No’” (translation: just say NO) Band!

:sd[Band runs onto the field, plays “Championship”]

So once again, the band finds itself at the “Broke Down Palace” that is Claire Danes’ “So Called University.” Watch now as the band forms our favorite letter and plays “Brown Forevermore.”

:sd[Band forms B and plays Brown Cheering Song, followed by Ever True to Brown and marches off the field]

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, Secret Society members, and all you future politicians who smoke-but don’t ‘in-yale’ :sd[groan]-presenting an organization that took Stats ‘S/NC’, it’s the Brown University “precise to ten decimal places and statistically significant within a 95% confidence interval” band!

:sd[Band runs onto the field, forms Bell Curve]

We apologize for the lack of a normal distribution; the band has been known to be a bit noisy at times-:sd[pause]-not unlike candidate George W Bush. We would like to reassure our viewing audience that politicians with sordid pasts can be successful. For instance, our last two presidents have overcome their Yale degrees. Watch now as the band plays “Don’t You Worry ‘Bout a Thing.”

:sd[Band plays “Don’t You Worry ‘Bout a Thing.”]

Speaking of sordid pasts, the Justice Department has decided to broaden its investigation of the Skull & Bones Society. The investigation, which already covers numerous drug-smuggling charges and the Iran-Contra Affair, will be broadened to include the Waco incident. :sd[pause] Watch now from the Jury Box as the band identifies the defendant and plays the “Brown Forevermore.”

:sd[Band forms skull & bones, plays #3]

The Yale Club, in a bid to attract younger members, has decided to adopt “Casual Fridays”-get a chisel now to help remove those crusty Yale jackets. Another part of the plan calls for them to host next year’s MTV Movie awards. :sd[Whole sentence pronounced with a strawng southun’ accent, as to make ‘yell’ come out as ‘Yale:’] Asked for comment on the plan, George W said, “This year’s awards was so bad I had to yell!” Speaking of movies, can you identify which of the following Claire Danes has done recently?

:::script-list

- A. “Deep Blue Sea”
- B. “Mystic Pizza”
- C. “Harold Bloom”
- D. “My Life as a Dog”
- E. “Broke Down Palace”
- F. “The Princeton Band”

Watch now as the band shows its answer, and plays “Gimme Some Lovin’”

:sd[Band forms ‘B’, plays “Gimme Some Lovin’”]

Join us next week when the Bears take on Lafayette at home, which is good, because we honestly don’t know where Lafayette is. And finally, for your viewing pleasure, the band will once again flush itself out of the Yale Bowl.

:sd[Band spirals off the field.]
