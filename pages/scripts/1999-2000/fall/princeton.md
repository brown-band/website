## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization that likes to spend its nights in the Sun Lab, on its knees, learning Accessor Methods from the consultant, it’s the Brown University -- our objects are public; how ‘bout yours? -- BAND!

As a public service for those poor souls taking CS 15, the band would now like to present the complete source code for Tetris, as written by our illustrious president, Kyle. "_please,_ PLEASE let me pass this class..."

:sd[Band calls constructor method for football, plays "Championship"]

Hoping to provide you with the _actual_ code, the band turned to our splendiferous vice president, Julia. (Quietly:) "Huh? what’s that? ... oh." Um, it seems that Julia just dropped the class, so you’re all just out of luck.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization that tripled Brown’s endowment with one night’s panhandling on Thayer Street, it’s the Brown University "Richer than a Meeting Street Cafe mousse cake" Band!

:sd[Band onto field]

The Princeton Band, which is better endowed than Cornell, could afford to travel to today’s game in the solid-gold train powered by pure funk that daddy bought them. But for this week anyway, Brown is the funkiest band in the Ivy League. After all, P-funk is playing in Providence tomorrow. Watch now as the band takes last week’s "Sweet Home Chicago" and tears its roof off.

While winning the game may seem important, there are greater forces to be dealt with than the Princeton football team.

Watch now as the band takes off in its funk-powered space train to save the Universe from all that is Eeeeeevil (Band bites its collective pinky) and plays "You can Call me Al."

:sd[Band forms rocket, plays "Al"]

Having arrived at the Brown stadium to do battle with the forces of darkness, the band found itself confronted with none other than the infamous Princeton Band. However, we soon realized that the Princeton Band is not truly eeevil, but instead some sort of diet-evil. Left without any opposition, the band was victorious. Watch now as the band returns to Earth and plays "Bring that Funky Victory, Brown Boys."

Join us next week as Bruno takes on the "Rama-lama-ding-dongs" of URI and the Band gets to know your mom and dad during the Parents weekend festivities.
