Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's looking a little Big Green in the gills, it's the Brown University "i'm gonna - [vomit noise]" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
This is our special alumni ice show, and we've got some older feet on the ice today! We're aiming for zero hip replacements this year, so please take it slowly! Don't drop your teeth on the ice: that's the hockey team's job! And if you've fallen and you can't get up, make sure the other people you take down with you are flutes – we can't hear them anyway. Watch now as the band reminds you to sit up straight while you're young and plays Spine Warp.

Speaking of old people taking a tumble, the Old Man in the Mountain yote off Cannon Mountain in 2003. He was 12,000 years old though, so he had a good run. Here are some things still left to check out on your way to Dartmouth:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. The rum-munism of New Hampshire's state-owned liquor stores – although not from 11:45-midnight on Sundays, the Lord's 15 minutes</sli>
<sli>B. Fritz Wetherbee's New Hampshire Chronicle, which has been out of stories for several years but will still "tell you a story"</sli>
<sli>C. Vermont</sli>
<sli>D. Beloved NPR personality Jack Beatty, who really knows no more about the news than you do but has a lot of opinions</sli>
<sli>E. No seatbelt laws – live free and die! and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton band</sli>

So as the Dartmouth hockey team travels back into the woods, we get ready for our best and only trick. Everyone crossing paths – it's like the musical Into The Woods! Some are seeking the cape as red as blood, some freedom from the godmother who's locked you in a tower. Some of us just wish to go to the festival. Regardless, hopefully we can stay upright longer than the beanstalk. You'll never guess how we get the cow on the ice!
