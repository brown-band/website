Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that definitely didn’t pay to be here, it’s the Brown University “still waiting on that tennis scholarship” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

I’m not sure if the other groups know this, but this is a talent competition, not a talent show, and we’ve already won. It’s not even a contest! And we have all of elementary school’s greatest hits! A cursed doll! And an unconscionable amount of Sour Patch Kids! Now, we know a lot of other groups here prefer to express themselves through motion. So no offense to those who like to pop and lock and jam. But we don’t dance. Not a chance. Watch now as the band hits it out of the arc and plays We’re On This Bus Together.

There are plenty of reasons you should come to Brown. But we all know that negative ads work way better. So here’s an alphabetical list of reasons why you shouldn’t go anywhere else:

:::script-list

- A. Ann Coulter, Cornell class 1984,
- B. all of the Bad press Yale has been getting lately,
- C. Columbia’s core curriculum-- say that five times fast,
- D. Dartmouth: Not Even Once,
- E. how we ’re not EVEN going to mention two of them, and
- F. The Princeton band. And also Ted Cruz is the Zodiac killer.

At this time, we’d like to invite a member of the audience to join us because (a la Ratatouille) ANYONE CAN PLAY AN INSTRUMENT! ANYONE CAN JOIN THE BROWN BAND! Do we have any volunteers? :sd[Pick member of audience/plant]

:sd[After situating prefrosh/plant with cymbals] Watch now as the band seals the deal and plays You’d Be A DingDong to Go Anywhere Else.

Thank you for :sd[sighing] #joiningtheband! If you’d like, you can stay with us for the rest of our performance...? Or just go back to your seat and wonder how you could ever do anything that amazing again. And daydream about how in 60 years you’ll stare off into the corner of the ceiling as you recount this experience to a group of wholly uninterested and undeserving children, while all they can think about is how you’re way too old old for them to care.

:sd[after prefrosh/plant gets to seat, if applicable] After rehearsal, the Brown Band likes to go to our favorite dining hall named after fictional professor Josiah Carberry -- Josiah’s. Everyone’s number one choice when everything else is closed, Brown’s finest dining establishment boasts a wide assortment of one-dollar snacks, all sold for the low, low price of four dollars. Because remember: calories don’t count past midnight! Watch now as the band orders a campus favorite (and make sure to get the wording right on this one): a spicy chicken sandwich with cheese, and plays Take In Grease.

:sd[Band plays Take On Me.]

So: even if you weren’t recruited by the band, and even if you can’t carry a tune in a bucket, remember that anyone can play an instrument, and anyone can join the Band. Really: I mean it. And of course, if you were recruited for the Band, we expect our check in the mail by Tuesday. Brown Band Out.
