Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wasn't invited to Spring Weekend for the 69th year in a row, it's the Brown University "LET US IIIIIIIN" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

As you may know, Spring Weekend has a reputation for making musicians famous. In fact, literally every commercially successful musician in the last 30 years, from Chance the Rapper to Bruce Springsteen to The Wiggles, began their career in front of an undulating mass of Brown University students, right here. Tragically, it seems that the biggest stars always leave and never return to Brown ever again. :sd[express sadness or sadness substitute here]

So watch now as the band pines for Spring Weekends of old and plays We Want You Back.

To fulfill our required biannual civic participation inspiration appropriation projectâ„¢, this year, the Brown University Band has hacked the Spring Weekend database to make sure the people's voice is heard. Yes, that means we've completely overhauled the entire concert lineup and canceled a number of multi-thousand dollar musical acts a mere 38.7 hours before the show. But don't worry, we made sure to use the voice of Brown, aka BBA, to create our Spring Weekend for the People.

So with further ado-do-do, your new lineup is:

:::script-list

- A. a singular Jonas Brother
- B. Bernie Sanders
- C. "JoJo fucking Siwa"
- D. Zaddy Zimmt
- E. Lizzie McGuire in Rome, and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the Brown Band celebrates this truly organic lineup and plays Every Artist We Want.

If you're not looking forward to our new, improved lineup, that's OK, because the best part of Spring Weekend is looking back at it anyway. In the next 72 hours, it doesn't matter how much fun you have, how many times Binder plays the Unicorn Song, or even whether you found any of the treasure you buried on Thursday night, as long as you have the Snapchat memories saved to relive your glory days while you're waiting in line at Jo's next week. As Professor Josiah Carberry himself once said, what if the real Spring Weekend was the Snap stories we made along the way?

Watch now as the Band forgets to switch to landscape mode and plays Blueno Is Upside Down.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays For Bruno and For Brown.]

Catch us this weekend as we infiltrate the concert disguised as the What Cheer Brigade. Brown Band Out.
