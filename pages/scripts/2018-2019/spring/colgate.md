Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that sooome, it’s the Brown University “BODY once told me” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We realized that we had enough material to make an entire ice show with just songs from Shrek, so we did. After rewatching the entire franchise, we realized Shrek is surprisingly sad. Shrek tries so hard to impress Fiona’s parents, only to end up alienating them and straining his marriage. If we accept the premise that a dragon is somehow equivalent to a horse, Donkey and Dragon’s children are mules, meaning their line ends there. Donkey will never get to be a grandpa! The workers in Fairy Godmother’s factory don’t even have dental! But hey, sometimes it’s a cold and it’s a broken Wallelujah. Watch now as the band expresses itself through dance and plays In a Funk Town.

Lord Farquaad is ashamed of being small, but Puss in Boots is even smaller and he’s killing the game! Maybe it’s that snazzy footwear, or maybe it’s just Antonio Banderas. Either way, they’re lining up for a catbath. Whether you’re like Mongo the giant gingerbread cookie or more like regular Gingy, the size of your heart is more important than the size of your gumdrop buttons. Watch now as the band proves it’s not compensating for anything and plays “I Believe That Size Doesn’t Matter”

Shrek says that an ogre is like an onion because it has layers. But here’s the deal: all the layers of an onion are the same! It’s just layer after layer of delicious onion-y flavor – and tears. So we decided to unwrap our own layers, and here’s what we found:

Watch now as the Band finally stops coming and plays “All Onion”.

Now for our next trick. This is how we’re planning on winning Far Far Away Idol, So Far Far Away Thinks It Can Dance, The Far Far Away is Right, The Masked Far Far Away, The Far Far Away Factor, Far Far Away Gladiator, Far Far Away Ninja Warrior, Far Far A-Runway, AND Far Far Away’s Got Talent: With a far, far out performance of “In Far Far Away”!

It’s all Ogre now… or is it? The ice we skate is getting pretty thin, so Brown Band Out.
