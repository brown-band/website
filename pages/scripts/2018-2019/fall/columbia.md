## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, Febs and alumno, presenting an organization that marches around campus with impunity, it's the Brown University "shhhh it's a library" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We heard you got defunded. (uncomfortably long pause) :sd[count to 15 (but by counting to 6 and then counting to 9 (= 15, quick maths) but superfast and slightly whisper this]

So you probably don't have money for your shows anymore. Here's a list of some budget ASMR sounds you can use to replace them.

:sd[Note: Do these as close to the microphone as you can]

:::script-list

- A. :sd[blow into microphone, aggressively]
- B. :sd[try to put a whole bag of chips in your mouth]
- C. :sd[whisper] Hello Ken Swole, welcome to your haircut appointment, I'm bringing the buzzer close to your right ear now
- D. :sd[rip a piece of paper]
- E. :sd[make bird sounds] , and
- F. :sd[breathily whisper] The Princeton Band

:::

Watch now as the band forms a dollar sign and plays a soft, long-tone chromatic scale.

'Sup Brown sports fan. Some of the opinion articles we found in the Columbia Spectator really made us wonder, why would we want to know that you are "merely a piece of fruit to be observed and represented?" But nothing will ever top this impassioned defense of Juuling by one Columbia student:

> I swear to God, when I'm hitting the Juul first thing on a beautiful Tuesday morning, everybody is falling over themselves to remind me about the possible [FDA Juul ban](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/12/17850598/fda-juul-vaping) and the numerous health concerns surrounding Juuls. And I get it. They've made some points. But what really grinds. my. gears. is that these very same people, on a sweaty Saturday night, become my Juul's biggest stans.

Watch now as the band forms two Juul pods... or are those Tide pods? — either way, we're gonna eat them — and plays Brown (y)Eating Song.

:sd[Band forms a lowercase B and plays #2.]

Catch us at halftime as we bid so long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye. Adieu, adieu, to you and you and you... to our seniors. Brown Band out. :sd[whisper: I flit, I float, I fleetly flee, I fly]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that will grieve the loss of its soon-to-be crusties, it's the Brown University "talk to your doctor about hemorrhoid cream" BAND!!!

I know what you're all asking, what is a crusty? Well, here in the band, we believe in the bandie lifecycle. The cycle begins with birth, from mom, currently Summer, and ends with death. Exactly four years after your birth, you do not die; rather, you crust. We still love you though. Watch now as the band toasts its newest stockpile of toasty uncrustables: the class of 2019!

:sd[Band forms a champagne glass with senior bubbles and plays "Bits and Pieces" after each senior Limerick.]

_He's the player with fab silky mitts\
Kellan Barr keeps the time with his sticks\
To the band, he explains\
The ways of the game\
And he would die for his dear Patriots_

_Sean is a lad fond of history\
with trivia as strong as artillery\
He'll show you around Brown\
He holds band archives down\
how he wound up in Brooklyn's a myst'ry_

_Of Tracy we couldn't be prouder\
At cheers, she's an excellent shouter\
In math, she's a pro\
The fact's fun; tally-ho!\
So what you're telling me is "I should play louder?"_

_Christie's arrangements make us all giddy,\
Her piccolo playing's real pretty,\
Her Camera points at our faces,\
Takes perfect pics in all places,\
Her yellow gear lights up the city._

_Our Natalovely is Del-worth-a-lot,\
The best cymbal crashes, she's got,\
Owen Wilson's biggest fan\
Karn Evil's her jam\
She'll be conducting the beat of our hahts... :sd[Owen Wilson voice] wow_

_This one's for Shane from Montana\
Whose favorite Grande's Ariana\
Whose hair we adore\
studied in Ecuador\
And safewalkin' with Christopher Walkin-a_

_Here's to our douch bag named Sam-FA\
He's part of the percussion fam-fa\
Stuck in Holley and Barus\
His bucket hat's garish\
420 blaze it k'BLAM-fa_

_He's the Zack that smiles back (Goldstein)\
This little jazz boy on the sax\
He just loooves the band,\
And his dance moves are grand,\
If you don't vote, he'll give you a SMACK_

_This one's for our drummer Katie\
Who kills it at field hockey daily\
She's got third highest saves\
Eats chicken nuggets for days\
Our guy fieri we will miss greatly_

_Berets off for dear Isabela,\
A semester in France she did spend-a,\
From Boca Raton,\
Her flute skills she's shown, \
Leaf watch, we will always rememba_

_Sir Charles, this one's for you\
Skilled with drums of 2+2,\
A master of rhythms,\
Understands mechanisms\
Of dark matter physics, through and through_

_The patriotic and spirited Mark, \
On the pre-med journey, he embarked\
From West Coast to East\
One of those BDH beasts,\
:sd[JOSHUA PEROGATIVE BY TRUMPETS]\
And the hoooooome of the brave_

_Our lovely vice president Adam\
Mad bass clarinet skillz, he's gaht 'em :sd[that's supposed to be "got" but in a Boston accent]\
With aliens, his fear,\
His plants he holds dear\
It's no wonder we all call him Dadam_

_Our very own sweet Caroline,\
Catch her dancing at party time\
In her oversized blazer\
Scripts as sharp as a razor\
With cards your future she'll divine_

_From a galaxy far far away,\
Comes Tim with jazzy music to play\
with a cheer of boo boo ga\
no one bleeds on his watch\
Our meemaw from Massacheychey_

_Gaby U, the axel to our rod, (wonk)\
Top of low brass, our S&M god (wonk)\
Ask her about shist,\
But why are we like this?\
Forever the prez of this squad (wonk)_

_Here's to Sofia Venegas,\
Who comes up with the most killer playlist!\
Who hits home runs,\
And bangs the drums,\
Her bat tricks will surely make her famous_

Yay seniors! You did it. You're GRAAADUATING! 4. More. Bears!!!\
Catch us at the last game of the season, and hear us play some sweet tunes to kick off this nuclear winter! See you all shivering in Hanover.\
Brown Band, OUT!
