Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that packed a lunch for the trip, it's the Brown University "we drove the length of a state to come here" BANDDDDD!

Something smells fishy, URI. We're not sure if it's the recent success of your football team or your new $1.5 million tuna research facility, or some combination of both. The stench also got us wondering – if tuna is the chicken of the sea, does that make chicken the tuna of the land? All we know is that you can't tuna fish, or tuna URI band. Luckily we'll only be here for a few hours today – in fact, we'll be here just long enough to ride every single one of your new shuttles by the time we leave. As we ride the shuttle and ponder what to get our degrees in, here are a few of our favorite URI concentrations, or as you guys like to call them, "majors":

<sli>A. Aquaculture and Fishery Technology</sli>
<sli>B. Textile Marketing</sli>
<sli>C. Marine Affairs</sli>
<sli>D. High Altitude Baking</sli>
<sli>E. Turfgrass Management, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band.</sli>

Watch now as the Band tries not to think about the smell and plays Funky Tuna.

<sd>Band forms an increasingly smiley face and plays Funkytown</sd>

We've also heard that URI opened its new Artificial Intelligence Lab, which is the first such facility to ever be opened in a university library. Of course, this will only hasten the impending robot apocalypse, so we're not sure we're fans. On the other hand, it's good to hear that the AI is designed to "give students technical skills" and "understandings of ethical issues". Those will probably come in handy for students majoring in High Altitude Baking.

Watch now as the Band celebrates organic lifeforms and plays Definitely Not a Robot Bear.

That's all for us this time, catch us next week when we'll be taking on Princeton in the beautiful state of New Joisey. Brown Band out.<sbr/>
