Ladies and gentlemen, Febs and alumno, presenting an organization that marches around campus with impunity, it's the Brown University "shhhh it's a library" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
We heard you got defunded.  (uncomfortably long pause) <sd>count to 15 (but by counting to 6 and then counting to 9 (= 15, quick maths) but superfast and slightly whisper this</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
So you probably don't have money for your shows anymore. Here's a list of some budget ASMR sounds you can use to replace them.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Note: Do these as close to the microphone as you can</sd>
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. <sd>blow into microphone, aggressively</sd></sli>
<sli>B. <sd>try to put a whole bag of chips in your mouth</sd></sli>
<sli>C. <sd>whisper</sd> Hello Ken Swole, welcome to your haircut appointment, I'm bringing the buzzer close to your right ear now</sli>
<sli>D. <sd>rip a piece of paper</sd></sli>
<sli>E. <sd>make bird sounds</sd>, and</sli>
<sli>F. <sd>breathily whisper</sd> The Princeton Band</sli>

Watch now as the band forms a dollar sign and plays a soft, long-tone chromatic scale.

'Sup Brown sports fan. Some of the opinion articles we found in the Columbia Spectator really made us wonder, why would we want to know that you are "merely a piece of fruit to be observed and represented?" But nothing will ever top this impassioned defense of Juuling by one Columbia student:<sbr/>
<blockquote><sbr/>
I swear to God, when I'm hitting the Juul first thing on a beautiful Tuesday morning, everybody is falling over themselves to remind me about the possible <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/9/12/17850598/fda-juul-vaping">FDA Juul ban</a> and the numerous health concerns surrounding Juuls. And I get it. They've made some points. But what really grinds. my. gears. is that these very same people, on a sweaty Saturday night, become my Juul's biggest stans.<sbr/>
</blockquote>

<sp>
Watch now as the band forms two Juul pods... or are those Tide pods? <smdash/> either way, we're gonna eat them <smdash/> and plays Brown (y)Eating Song.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms a lowercase B and plays #2.</sd>

<sp>
Catch us at halftime as we bid so long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye. Adieu, adieu, to you and you and you... to our seniors. Brown Band out. <sd>whisper: I flit, I float, I fleetly flee, I fly</sd>

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that will grieve the loss of its soon-to-be crusties, it's the Brown University "talk to your doctor about hemorrhoid cream" BAND!!!
</sp>
<sp>
I know what you're all asking, what is a crusty? Well, here in the band, we believe in the bandie lifecycle. The cycle begins with birth, from mom, currently Summer, and ends with death. Exactly four years after your birth, you do not die; rather, you crust. We still love you though. Watch now as the band toasts its newest stockpile of toasty uncrustables: the class of 2019!

<em>He's the player with fab silky mitts<sbr/>

<em>Berets off for dear Isabela, <sbr/>
