Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that might be being followed around by bees, it's the Brown University "nope, just our kazoo section!" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
Yes, it's family weekend here at Brown, and that means our kazoo section is back! They're not real bugs, they're our relatives. If you're looking for genuine insects, though, it sounds like there are plenty at Cornell â€“ enough for an event called the Insectapalooza! If you feel up to the challenge, you can stick your hand in a bucket of maggots, or let a scorpion walk across your arm. It's a six-hour drive, but if you start now you might just make it!

Watch now as the band forms a bug flying over Lake Cayuga and plays Lots of Flies.

Being reunited with our good ol' parents and guardians really makes us think about youth's fleeting hours. So Cornell, we were wondering if you could advise us on what to do with our college years. However, we're questioning your judgement after finding your bucket list, which includes these real items:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Fail your swim test, just for kicks</sli>
<sli>B. Road trip to Canada, flirt with the border patrol, smuggle booze back</sli>
<sli>C. "...weep when it rains..."</sli>
<sli>D. Watch Ezra and Andrew be friends at midnight</sli>
<sli>E. Found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Don't worry Mom, I think we'll stick to the Naked Donut Run. Watch now as the Band gets ready for its swim test and plays In the Pool.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that furiously cleaned our rooms last night, it's the Brown University "yes Mom, it's always this clean" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We'd like to offer our sincere, and quite belated, congratulations to Ithaca for being ranked one of Outside Magazine's top 10 American river towns! According to the review, Ithaca "isn't your classic river town", which makes sense, because there isn't actually a river! What does Outside Magazine know that we don't? Watch now as the Band plays Happy to Live in a Real River Town.
