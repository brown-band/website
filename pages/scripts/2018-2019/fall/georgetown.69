Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has a few more gray hairs than usual, it's the Brown University "back in my day" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

This week we're welcoming back our alumni for this special homecoming game! We made sure to include things at our breakfast reception that would make them feel more at home:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Prune juice</sli>
<sli>B. Cream of Wheat</sli>
<sli>C. Bran flakes</sli>
<sli>D. Ovaltine</sli>
<sli>E. Frequent bathroom breaks, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Watch now as the band Depends on our old friends and Time Warps to back in their day.

A few things have changed since our alums last showed up on the Hill. For one thing, both Wilsons have now been replaced, so thankfully the change of JWW means one less acronym to memorize.  But not to fear, we've got a new one for ya: Friedman actually stands for Flamingos Running In Excited Dances Making A Nuisance. Watch now as the band pays tribute to the longest building name on campus and plays I'm a Pink Bird Born.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that hasn't been to church in a while, it's the Brown University "and also with you" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Peace be with you, Georgetown. We're glad you made the trip all the way up here from DC, although frankly, we'd find any excuse to get out of the beltway if we were you. It's astonishing you made it considering the traffic – and you had to go through Jersey! DC is home to an astonishing collection of snakes, vermin, and weasels – and it's home to the National Zoo! So we're glad you made it out for a weekend to hang with the Bears. Watch now as the band forms the Washington Monument and plays Take On Corruption.

It's no Mystery of Faith: Georgetown is a Catholic school. We haven't had the chance to play a Catholic school since we got kicked out of Holy Cross, and we can't wait to resurrect our jokes about the faith. The players on the field have to stay in peak metaphysical condition, but we've been working out too, using a method with which you'll be familiar: Christian Calisthenics, also known as Mass. Here's our favorite moves:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Sit</sli>
<sli>B. Stand</sli>
<sli>C. Kneel</sli>
<sli>D. Stand</sli>
<sli>E. Sit, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>

Watch now as the band forms a chalice and plays We're All In One Body of Christ Together.

We have to admit, when we heard that John Mulaney is an alum of yours, it was tempting to borrow Kid Gorgeous wholesale. Our favorite, of course, is his "horse in a hospital" bit, but we've been wondering, what kind of horse? Clydesdale? Thoroughbred? Shetland Pony? It could even be a Trojan horse, although we know you aren't so familiar with Trojans over there. Watch now as the band shows off our STREET SMARTS and plays our Brown Horse-Fearing Song.

Catch us next week as we square off with URI in the 75th Governor's Cup. Too old to be a duckling, quack quack! Brown Band Out.<sbr/>
