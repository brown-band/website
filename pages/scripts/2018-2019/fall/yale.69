Hi Yale! We heard you have a mouse in your house! There have been mouse sightings in three different dining halls, several dorms and academic buildings, and Bass library. And yes, that's a little gross, but think of the possibilities! You could develop your own versions of the board game Mouse Trap with real mice, or organize them into the finest fighting force west of the Quinnipiac River. You could even sew them little costumes and make The Rescuers on home video! Infestation, or blessing in disguise? Watch now as the band proves that anyone can cook and plays Carry On Rescuing My Wayward Mice.

Speaking of other small, cute creatures, let's talk about the fact that the Yale Baby School is celebrating its first birthday with a Halloween party! The Baby School teaches new parents how to care for their little ones, as well as studying babies up-close, and for Halloween they had face-painting and trick-or-treating for the babies! All to celebrate that a year ago Yale had a baby of its own when the Baby School launched. Congrats to them, but we're not ready for that kind of responsibility yet; we're enjoying sleeping in at the Sleep Center while we can.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's already dreaming of hockey season, it's the Brown University "Blades of Glory" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

There's been a stir on Brown's campus recently after an article was published in the Brown Daily Herald calling for the end of all sports except for the one that's doing the best right now. A hot take, but not the first time something like this has been suggested. Ten years ago, a student at Yale wrote a similar article. In real life, we'd hate to see all the athletes' hard practice hours go to waste, but as chaotic neutrals, we're curious to explore what this would actually entail. As an organization that will try anything once, it's fitting that we'll be taking this mental journey with Ned Fulmer, the married one from the Try Guys, and the student who wrote your article. Watch now as the band likes and subscribes and plays We'd All Be In This Together.

Let's get to thinking - what would actually happen if we did this? First things first, we'd get kicked out of the Ivy League. That would be pretty sad, we'd probably have to take out that ivy branch that snakes through the B from our sports logo! Maybe we could replace it with something else, like a daisy chain! We think that would capture our whimsical nature. What do you think, Ned? We're sure a good Buzzfeed video could convince Yale to join us. Watch now as the band contemplates its one-sports-team existence and plays We'd Be Happy Together With Yale.

Yale, we beseech you - join us. Here's a list of all the things we could accomplish in a league of our own:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Hold ½ instead of ⅛ of the league, thus becoming 4x as powerful</sli>
<sli>B. Sell our extremely rare tickets for hundreds, no, THOUSANDS of dollars</sli>
<sli>C. Spend ticket revenue to gift Yale a twin Blueno </sli>
<sli>D. Make *The* Game literal </sli>
<sli>E. Buy the world's biggest bone for Handsome Dan, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Watch now as the band dreams about our league together and plays Brown and Yale Forevermore.
