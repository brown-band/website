## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s keeping their hands, feet, and mouths to themselves, it’s the Brown University “buy some Purell” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Hello Dartmouth! It’s good to see you again. We hope you don’t mind if we keep our distance this visit - we heard you’re feeling a bit under the weather. We’re feeling a little bit over the weather here in New Hampshire, but that’s beside the point. We heard that not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven, not eight, not nine, not ten, not eleven, not twelve, not thirteen, not fourteen, not fifteen, not sixteen, not seventeen, not eighteen, not nineteen, not twenty, not twenty-one, not twenty-two, not twenty-three, not twenty-four, not twenty-five, not twenty-six, not twenty-seven, not twenty-eight...

Watch now as the Band catches their breath and plays Karn Evil Not 29.

not thirty, not thirty-one, not thirty-two, not thirty-three, not thirty-four, not thirty-five, not thirty-six, not thirty-seven, not thirty-eight, not thirty-nine, not forty, not forty-one, not forty-two, not forty-three, not forty-four, not forty-five, not forty-six, not forty-seven, not forty-eight, not forty-nine, but fifty OF YOUR STUDENTS have come down with Hand-Foot-Mouth. Wow. We made it!

Watch now as the band celebrates finally being done with this dumb bit and plays Counting Victory.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Bring the Victory.]

Catch us at halftime when the band continues to show off our advanced math skills. Brown Band out.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that cited all its sources, it’s the Brown University “Chicago or APA?” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Dartfoot, we need to have a serious talk about copyright infringement. Did you get permission from Hilton to use their logo? We would’ve thought you had learned your lesson after 43 students were implicated in a cheating scandal in an ethics class in 2014. But maybe our expectations were too high. After all, when a bunch of students were caught cheating in a computer science course, you had to drop all the charges because they couldn’t actually figure out who had cheated.

Watch now as the Band forms an upside-down Doubletree logo and plays Come On, Eileen, Stop Cheating!

:sd[Band makes the Dartmouth Logo and plays Come On Eileen.]

Speaking of things that stink, we also read that something called a corpse flower is blooming at Dootmoot soon? Apparently it can give off a range of smells “from dirty diapers to rotting flesh”. First of all, what? Second of all, have you tried cracking a window? When you spend 10 months out of the year with the hatches battened down protecting yourself from winter weather, you start to lose touch with what the rest of us smell like. (Hint: it’s not dirty diapers and rotting flesh.)

Watch now as the Band embodies the essence of the corpse flower and plays what dirty diapers smell like.

:sd[Band makes Clippy and plays.]

We noticed that the Dartbeat has a page that is just a list of lists. Here is a list of some of those lists because nothing ever happens at Darkmoth so we have given up on having anything interesting to say.

:::script-list

- A. The Most Comprehensive Instant Noodle Review
- B. Your Flair Horoscope
- C. Thirteen Songs for an Alternative Foco Playlist
- D. A List of Everything that has Ever Happened at Darthand Ever (this one went to a 404 page not found error)
- E. The Greeks Shall Inherit the Earth, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Watch now as the Band is incredibly bored and plays Bored Bear.

Catch us next week as we stay inside and enjoy having not discolored water. Brown Band out.
