Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that knows that the powder on Tastykake donuts is like 70% cornstarch, it's the Brown University "but go off I guess" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

It's battle of the cities that start with P today, folks, as we play the University of Pennsylvania. And it's Halloweekend, the only thing spookier than how late the SEPTA runs. We've got our costumes, but we heard you've got something even eerier – a whole research center devoted to ghosts! The Penn Ghost Project combines ghastly workings from archaeology, art history, religious studies, and nursing and medicine; we would hope the medical students would be more interested in preventing ghosts than documenting them though.

From what we've heard you've been taking your football team on the beginnings of a world tour - first Providence, then Beijing! We're sorry you'll be flying out of Newark (say hi to the Princeton Band for us while you're in New Jersey), but maybe you'll bring us back a souvenir? No? A postcard? If we had the chance to travel the world, here are the must-sees at the top of our list:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. The Icelandic Phallological Museum,</sli>
<sli>B. The world's tallest filing cabinet, in Vermont</sli>
<sli>C. Carhenge, in Nebraska, </sli>
<sli>D. The Museum of Pizza Culture in Philly,</sli>
<sli>E. Area 51, and</sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band</sli>

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just wants to let any vampires in the audience know that at this point in the semester not having to eat or sleep sounds pretty good, it's the Brown University "hewwo?" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Penn, normally we'd be happy that you had the chance to escape Philadelphia for a weekend, but we were sad to hear that this weekend, Pennsylvania trees are forecasted to be at peak color! Rain, fungi, warmth, and vampires: all threats to leaves. Have you thought about planting garlic in with all your sidewalk trees? Or whittling your tree branches into pre-made wooden stakes? Fun fact: hanging mirrors on all your trees will also help to keep the fungi away. It won't keep out that new monster Venom, though, that's taking movie theaters and people who liked The Shape of Water way too much by storm. Watch now as the Band gets kicked out of the theater and plays I Touch Myself.

So, Penn, let's talk about our favorite orange monster, Gritty!! We're amazed by his sudden rise to fame - his first day as a mascot for the Philadelphia Flyers didn't go so hot, after being booed by his own fans, he fell on the ice and shot someone in the back with his hot dog launcher. It's okay Gritty, we're all nervous the first time. But, he's quickly won our hearts with his luxurious mane, beautiful bouncing eyes, and his commitment to concussion prevention! Watch now as the Band salutes our dear Comrade Gritty and plays I'm Not a Believer in Capitalism.

Moving from one loose cannon to the next, we heard that your mayor - Michael Nutter - signed a law four years ago decriminalizing marijuana. Nice! We also heard that you had some anniversary celebrations this weekend, which makes sense seeing as it's peak leaf season. Thanks for the invite, Penn. Ironically, we heard your football team also got smoked out of the Yale Bowl. Maybe you should just stick to weed smoothies instead... actually, now that you mention it, do you have any snacks? Watch now as the Band tries to feed its munchies and plays some food and some more food.
