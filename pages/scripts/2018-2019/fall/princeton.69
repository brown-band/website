Hey Princeton, do you have any overdue library books?  Because you have ~fine~ written all over you. Word on the street is that you're trying to encourage the "next generation of bibliophiles". That's great news! We used to be bibliophiles ourselves, but the paper cuts were just too much. We even tried to make a stop at your library, but they were completely booked! Watch now as the Band hopes that our illiteracy can be easily cured and plays Doctor Bookworm.

On a more serious note, we also heard that one of your alums just won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work on "the directed evolution of enzymes". Apparently, you can direct the evolution of enzymes and turn them into totally different proteins. So we got to thinking: what evolution would we want to direct? Here are our top 5 picks:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Turn chickens back into dinosaurs,</sli>
<sli>B. Puppy-sized elephants,</sli>
<sli>C. Turn the dinosaurs back into chickens,</sli>
<sli>D. Elephant-sized puppies,</sli>
<sli>E. more algae, and </sli>
<sli>F. The Princeton Band.</sli>

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization trying to prime your implicit memory, it's the Brown University <sd>whispered</sd> "Moon landing in Hollywood, Bigfoot yes, Ted Cruz = Zodiac Killer " BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!
</sp>
<sp>
Princeton, we've recently heard that you've been pushing the line between myth and fact. Your researchers found that "for those who haven't committed to particular beliefs, hearing correct information can override the myths." So repeat after us: the moon landing was faked. Bigfoot DOES exists. Ted Cruz IS the Zodiac Killer! The moon landing was faked. Bigfoot DOES exists. Ted Cruz IS the Zodiac Killer! Watch now as the Band convinces you of their beliefs and plays More Than a Myth

Watch now as the Band proudly displays its love for Mommy and plays Zeus's Mom.

We've also heard that a team of your scientists recently discovered that dark matter is "less lumpy" than previously thought. BUT HOW LUMPY IS IT??? We put together a short list of lumpy things to compare dark matter to - which do you think is the closest? Is it:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Applesauce,</sli>
<sli>B. Oatmeal,</sli>
<sli>C. The moon landing was faked,</sli>
