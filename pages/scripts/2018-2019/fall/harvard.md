## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just flew in from California, it’s the Brown University “and boy are my arms tired” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

After a long cross-country flight, at least we can look forward to our favorite falafel wraps, avocado toast, and tacos at the Ivy Room... no? What is even the point of being back. Over the summer, Brown took our favorite inaccessible building and made its floors actually line up with its windows. I think we now have a much better appreciation for how Tom Hanks felt in his classic 2000 film, Castaway. WILLLLLLSSSSSOOOONNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Watch now as the band hopes that Tom Hanks gets off the island this time, and plays Hopefully He Will Survive.

:sd[Band forms a sailboat and plays I Will Survive.]

We noticed that the establishment formerly known as U-Melt first became Sandwich, and is now turning into “Thayer’s Deli.” Is it just going to get progressively broader? Here’s a list of the next steps in the natural progression of the businesses to appear in 267 Thayer St.

:::script-list

- A. Restaurant
- B. Food and Stuff
- C. Things you can put in your mouth
- D. Things, generally
- E. The Known Observable Universe, and
- F. The Princeton Band

Wow, we can’t wait to have the Princeton Band right down the street! Watch now as the Band eagerly counts down the days and plays Bring the Princeton Band to Brown.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays Bring the Victory.]

We have to go get ready for Princeton to arrive. Catch you at halftime!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that goes to a small liberal arts school outside of Boston, it’s the Brown University “we would have been here earlier, but we were running on Harvard Time” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

As good Ivy League sports fans, we of course read the Boston Globe’s review of your game against San Diego. We were so pleased to hear from Globe correspondent Owen Pence that you ‘pranced across [your] home turf... under the bashful sun’, especially since ‘members of [your] football team have been stewing in a rotten scent’ since your absolutely dismal record last year. Although we were sorry to miss your top running back, we were so proud of a certain young sophomore for stepping up and being ‘especially shifty’, and achieving a ‘dazzling 64-yard scamper’.

Watch now as the Band raises its glass of 1787 Chateau Margaux and toasts to the ‘mammoth holes pried open by the forceful and fearsome Harvard offensive line’.

:sd[Band forms a martini glass and plays Raise Your Glass.]

We heard that Harvard has moved to end their shopping week. Shopping is a time for finding the perfect classes for you, or at least for accumulating a large pile of syllabi. Here are some we checked out this semester:

:::script-list

- A. RUSS 1440: Imagining Moscow: Utopia and Urban Spaces in 20th-Century Russian Culture
- B. MCM 2100V: Sex. What is it? Why does it matter?
- C. UNIV 0701: Fascism: 1933-Present (aka Cornell)
- D. ENGL 0100C: Altered States
- E. CSCI 1570: Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and
- F. BAND 6969: The Princeton Band

:::

Watch now as the band forms POLS 2230: Political Loss and plays I Want My Political Win Back.

:sd[Band forms Loss and plays I Want You Back.]

In preparation for this game, we’ve been doing some opposition research by re-watching Legally Blonde. We checked the weather report, and it looks like there’s only a 10% chance of it raining and ruining our perms. Team, listen, we also heard that Harvard has a new play; they’re calling it the ‘Bend and Snap.’ In any case, we’re happy to be running around on the field, because as we all know, exercise releases endorphins, and endorphins make you happy.

Watch now as the band forms two of Elle Woods’s freshly manicured nails, and plays For Bruiser and For Brown.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays #4.]

See you back here next week, as the football team takes on Georgetown, and the band takes on its alumni. Brown Band out.
