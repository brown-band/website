## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and parents, presenting an organization that that just voted to impeach itself, it’s the Brown University "Fordham? I hardly know ‘em!" Band!

So, how about that Fordham? What to say about Fordham…what to say…

-long pause-

Mmmmm…pork…

Watch now as the band forms a pigskin and plays "Out, Damned Fox! Out I say!"

:sd[Band forms football, plays NFL on Fox]

:sd[Band forms B, plays #4]

:sd[Band plays #1, moves over, plays National Anthem]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and parents, presenting an organization that is ready to fulfill its own manifest destiny by taking over the field, it’s the Brown University "On a mission from God" Band!!!

:sd[Kyle and Pfeffer run screaming onto field, band straggles behind.]

Today, we’d like to welcome back the Brown Brothers, the Band’s fearless leadership. However, while the brothers took a few semesters off, the Band’s uniforms changed a bit. And while the Brown Band is a scatter band, without the leadership of the Brown Brothers, the band has become even more scattered than it used to be. Watch now as the Brown Brothers attempt to get the band back together and plays "Hold On, I’m Comin.’"

:sd[Band forms sunglasses, plays "Hold On, I’m Comin.’"]

The Band recently got shafted by Brown’s shrunken endowment, which took a beating when the stock market went down. With the band back together, it was able to muster up a back beat…or a beat back at the tiny endowment. Watch now as the band raises hell…that is, raises money…by forming the stock market, collapsing, and playing Gimme Some Money.

:sd[Band forms a stock graph (going down), does the domino band thing (percussion could perhaps play a cadence or something here?) and plays "Gimme Some Lovin.’"]

The band decided there was no better place to start fundraising than with President Gee. He agreed to help under two conditions: that we play more country and western music than we usually do, and that we add bow ties to our uniforms. Watch now as the band tries to concede to these requests by forming a bow tie and playing "Rawhide".

:sd[Band forms bow tie and plays "Rawhide." Meanwhile, some bandies are country line dancing and one is cracking a bullwhip.]

Meanwhile, we had our share of troubles…for instance, there was that time when our fearful…I mean, fearless, leaders were chased around by a maniacal woman brandishing a Super Soaker. :sd[Kate Brucher chases Pfeff and Kyle around with a Super Soaker.] But maybe she was only looking for a little love. Watch now as the Band forms a heart and plays "Everybody Needs Somebody to Love."

:sd[Band does just this.]

While the Band’s big guns were being pursued with a big water gun, President Gee was coming up with a new test for the Band to prove its worth. He offered us this devious challenge: if we could add 1 and 1, he would spring for new uniforms.

So, Band, what is one plus one?

:sd[Band starts scattering.]

Watch now as the Band forms the answer.

:sd[Pause, as Band continues scattering.]

Uh…it looks like the Band is a little confused on this one.

:sd[Pause.]

What _is_ one plus one, anyway?

:sd[Band forms amorphous blob.]

Watch now as the band sums up that thought by playing "Think."

:sd[Band plays "Think."]

When Gee realized that there weren’t any math concentrators in the Band, he revised his test. "Band," he asked, "what is the seventh letter of the alphabet?" Unfortunately, when we studied the alphabet in preparation for this new challenge, for some reason we couldn’t get past the letter "B." We decided that the only thing to do was to flee in embarrassment. The Brown Brothers looked at each other and declared, "We’re 106 miles from campus, we’ve got fifty bandies, we’re tanked, and we’re wearing sunglasses. Hit it."

:sd[Band forms a B, plays "Sweet Home Chicago."]

Thank you for joining us today. Join us next week as the Brown Band stains the field with the Penn Band.

:sd[Band steps off to #1.]
