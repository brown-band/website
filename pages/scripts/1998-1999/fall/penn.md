## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is able to leap the SciLi at a single bound, it’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s an emu, it’s the Brown University "Faster Than a Speeding Bullet" Band! And we are cute, too.

The band was excited by this week’s match-up. There’s so much going on here. A match against a team coached by one of our former quarterbacks, Joe Paterno. The first meeting since 1983. It’s got the makings of a classic. What? Is that so? Forgive me. I’ve just been informed we’re playing the B team of Penn State. Never mind.

Watch now as the band leaves itself in stitches and plays a foxy flourish.

:sd[Form football, play "NFL on Fox"]

Wait! This just in! The admissions department at Upenn is eliminating football scholarships! Break out the rule book for flag football, folks.

The band will now salute its far superior athletes as they play For Bruno and For Brown.

:sd[Form B, play #4]

:sd[National Anthem]

# Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves making itself bigger, it’s the Brown University "Somewhat Sizeable, Snuffleupigitarian, Antidisestablismentarianistic, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocialistic, Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosistic, Nutritious and Delicious (and packed with vitamin C) Superfantastic Filibustering" Band!

In a step towards declaring martial law in Philly, the university has broken ground on a headquarters for the University of Pennsylvania City District. These ambassadors to the streets will demand that all people in the city get academic credit for what they’re doing. You’re a peanut vendor? Three credits for entrepreneurial spirit. You’re a homeless person? Three credits for clearing out on parents’ weekend. You’re a kid running through the streets? Three credits for training for the Penn Relays. Watch now as the band forms a half credit and earns a UPenn music degree by playing New Orleans.

The Band would now like to move on to the educational part of our show. Today’s topic will be neuroscience. The tectospinal and rubrospinal descending motor pathways decussate anterior to the pons, while the vestibulospinal tract and reticulospinal tract do not decussate. Ultimately, however, descending cortical pathways are the most important muscular control routes, as electrophysiological stimulation of the M1 and premotor regions of the cortex often result in random twitching. :sd[Band gets a leg twitch] and OH NO! It looks like the entire band is suffering from a spontaneous leg twitch. Come on, Band! Pull through! :sd[Band snaps legs down, Penn Band style.] Ah. Much better. Watch now as the band forms a synapse and plays "Spinal Countdown".

Robert Redford recently announced plans to build a theater for experimental cinema at UPenn. Coinciding with these plans, a specialty foods market is also to be built. The Brown Band wondered at the juxtaposition of these two edifices, and decided that it was not a coincidence. Here are some things we think they should serve at the movie snack bar:

- Chocolate Sneakers
- Not-so-Ordinary People’s Leftovers
- Out of African Dogs
- The Natural Nacho, complete with Newman’s Own organic cheese spread
- The Horse Whisperer’s cheese baked scrod

And the prices? An indecent proposal if you ask us. But hey—we’ll manage as long as they serve cinema rolls. Oh, and we hear that the first film to be shown there will be Robert Redford’s latest, "All the President’s Women." Watch now as the band forms some all-natural, organic popcorn (we could pop…) and plays "Brown Bear"

:sd[Band forms a B and plays "Brown Bear"]

Thank you for joining us today…join us next week, as we head for the northeast corner of nowhere and take on Cornell.
