## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that will remain nameless for another few words, it’s the Brown University "Palmer? I Hardly Know ‘Er!" BAND!!!

We’d like to welcome you all to our show today. This is actually our first time playing at the Vince Lombardi Memorial Rest Stop. There’s only one thing confusing us, though…we can’t find the Roy Rogers. Watch now as the Band pays tribute to fast-food cuisine by forming a pigskin and playing something Foxy.

:sd[Band forms football and plays Fox Sports Themes]

So now that we’ve eaten, we’re going to sit back and enjoy the smog for a while. Ahhhh, that was refreshing…

Watch now as the Band forms a single, non-rotating B and plays A smog cheering song.

:sd[Band forms B and plays #2]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just christened the Vatican, it’s the Brown University "Holy WATER, Batman!" BAND!!!! Hello and welcome to Princeton’s new stadium. For lack of a better name…well, for lack of a name, we’ll call it the Electric Pussycat Swingers Club for now. With the help of the Brown Archeological Recovery Fellows, BARF, the Band decided to investigate Princeton’s old stadium. After playing in the dirt for a while, we came to a startling conclusion: the stadium was not built for football at all. Palmer stadium was actually erected for two sports: pole wrestling and the Winter Naked Olympics. (There was talk of a merged sport, but that fell by the waist-side.) The original plans never had seating – just poles for people to huddle and dance around. Watch now as the band forms a Palmer seat and plays bring the victory – wink, wink nudge, nudge, know what I mean, know what I mean?

:sd[Band Plays "Bring the Victory" and forms (rectangle??)]

The Band pondered this so-called "pole wrestling," and wondered where such a bizarre sport could have originated. But we think we have the answer: pole wrestling is actually the modern descendent of that ancient sport, pole DANCING. In true Princeton spirit, we’d like to keep an old, crusty, outdated tradition alive by declaring this new stadium a home for pole dancers everywhere. President Clinton recently heard about this grand Princeton tradition and demanded a luxury box in the new stadium. Ahhhh, luxury poll-dancing. Watch now as we toast President Clinton with a bottle of bubbly and play a tune from down South.

:sd[Band plays "New Orleans" and forms a bottle of champagne with bubbles coming over the top.]

Speaking of champagne, we’d like to share our real purpose in coming here today: to christen the new stadium. Here’s the list of names we came up with:

:::script-list

- A) Big Daddy’s Wad of Money
- B) Big Daddy’s Wad
- C) Bid Daddy
- D) The Woody Wo School of Foreign Affairs
- E) The Whoa, Woody! School of Pole Dancing
- F) The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band forms the letter of the name it chose and plays "You can call me Big Daddy."

:sd[Band plays "You Can Call Me Al" and forms B.]

Thank you for listening, and join us next week when some bold and daring New Yorkers venture out of the so-called center of the universe, and we take on Fordham.
