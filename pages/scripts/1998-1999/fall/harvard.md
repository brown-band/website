## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just a swig o’ root beer, it’s the Brown University "We got bite" Band!

The band recently heard about the travesty that is the Harvard Beer Company. It’s entirely understandable that the administration is suing; I don’t think they ever received their free kegs. And to think – they were on the verge of changing the school motto to In Beero Veritas. Such a shame. Watch now as the band forms a smooshed keg and plays "Bring me a beverage, you foxy wench!"

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just got vaccinated, it's the Brown University "bring on your crimson disease" Band!

We're happy to be here in germ-infested Cambridge. In fact, the band is looking into enhancing their sound much the same way the Harvard band has with their whooping cough section. Well, at least I’m up here, not subject to all of that… [break into coughing fit]. Ugh! It’s everywhere! With this recent outbreak of disease in Harvard, at least those Harvard students don't have to worry about STDs. Watch now as the band blows its nose and plays **_Bring the Kleenex_**.

In fact, a number of Harvard students from the past have serious debilitating diseases. FDR had polio, and Bill Gates suffers from acute desire to rule the world. Bill Gates recently announced his intention to take over the world on January 1st, 2000. He recorded the speech using voice recognition software. The following is an excerpt: " by a hot you beautiful weekly earthly is will be made to buy all my software play by instant big games for on a Bill Gates will rule vote world off hot off hot off you will bald be my slaves hot hot hot!" Watch now as the band forms a microphone and plays **_Everybody needs Somebody to Conquer_**.

We heard that Harvard students also contend with big head disease. Besides the more obvious problems big head disease causes, such as getting jammed in doorways or having charicature-like portraits, we discovered many other, less-obvious life-situations which arise with a big head. The following is a list of these plights:

:::script-list

- A) Really hard to give birth
- B) The enemies you form at the movie theater
- C) Your account with carpet wholesalers for that bald spot
- D) No instant photo booths for you
- E) You eclipse the Harvard bass drum
- E.5) You cut your hair with a John Deere
- F) The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band forms Siamese big heads and plays **_You Can Call Me Big Al_**.
