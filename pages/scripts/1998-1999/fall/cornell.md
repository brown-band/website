## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that prefers doubling your pleasure with the crisp freshness of Doublemint gum over Big Red, it’s the Brown University "Brown University" Band!

:sd[Band storms field.]

While you’re waiting for us to play some music, chew on this: did you know that ordinary gum can only be blown into <i>round</i> bubbles? However, the Brown Band recently discovered new chewing gum flavor crystals that let you blow a bubble in <i>any shape you want</i>! Think of the possibilities! National monuments…Dan Quayle’s head…a package from the Unabomber…just be careful not to let <i>that</i> one explode. Now <i>that’s</i> what I call a sticky situation. Watch now as the Band forms a football-shaped bubble and plays NFL on Fox.

:sd[Band does just this.]

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just invaded the Earth, it’s the Brown University "Elrod, phone home" Band!

The Brown Band recently joined forces with visiting aliens to take over the planet, just in time for Halloween. The aliens and the Band formed a small army, calling themselves the "Brownjackets."

:sd[Band marches onto field, blocked up in lines, looking like an actual marching band…until the lines start veering off, people trip, etc. Then the Band scatters.]

We wondered where to begin taking over the world, and decided to start with the place that would be least conspicuous: New Jersey. But realizing that aliens had colonized New Jersey already, we moved on to Ithaca. We decided that the first part of Ithaca we would conquer would be this stadium, in a Stadium Putsch. And hey, since it’s a stadium, we even have a cheer: putsch ‘em back, putsch ‘em back, waaayyyy back!

Watch now as the band forms a piece of the pie that got thrown at them, and plays Brown Alien Born.

:sd[Band forms 3, plays BMB]

Ladies and Gentlemen, we now interrupt this show for a commercial break.

:sd[Pause.]

Do you like getting lost in a crowd? Are you extraordinarily fond of the colors red and white? Then take a real close look at this dazzling new line of clothing, Where’s Waldo WaldoWear! As you can see on our model, this stunning red and white striped…wait a minute…where _is_ our model? Can YOU find him? Watch now as the band forms a question mark and plays "In a Gadda da Valdo."

:sd[Band forms question mark, plays "In a Gadda da Vida." There is, perhaps, a Waldo-clad bandie running around for this segment.]

And, for those of you who speak Spanish!

:sd[Band turns question mark upside-down.]

The aliens and the Band decided next to take over all print media – starting with the magazine most read for its articles, Playboy. To most effectively plot their takeover, the aliens (through Playboy) launched a revealing :sd[beat] survey about what would turn on a Cornell student, so that they could eugenically breed creatures that would be under the mind control of the Brown Band! Muahahaha! So what _does_ turn on a Cornell student, anyway?

Watch now as the aliens use this knowledge to seduce a Cornell student and spawn a Cornell bandie by forming a centerfold and playing "Don’t You Want Me, Baby."

:sd[Band does this.]

Thank you all for watching, and we hope that we hear Cornell Victorious.
