## Pregame

Senoritas y senores, amigos y graduados, presentemente una organizacion que le gusta tocarse, es el Brown Universidad "Bandito" Banda!

:sd[Banda corre sobre el campo.]

Esta manana, la Banda viajo por Columbia. Sin embargo, nos preguntamos que era una viaje bastante rapido, y…what? Columbia _University_? In New York? Ohhh! No wonder we didn’t have to take a boat or a plane! Um. Well, yeah. Let’s play some music now.

Watch now as the band forms an oblate spheroid and plays "NFL on Fox."

:sd[Band forms a football, plays that. And "In the Fray." And forms a B somewhere, I guess. Usual spiel.]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and Columbia sports columnists, presenting an organization that caused the recent drop in the stock market, it’s the Brown University "Antichrist" Band!

:sd[Band attacks the field.]

To the Editor:

It has recently come to my attention that the Brown University quote-unquote Band will be playing at today’s football game, and I just want to make it clear that I’m offended. I say we cancel today’s game. Forfeit. Award the victory to Brown, just to keep their godforsaken band off the field. Come to think of it, how can a fine institution such as Brown even consider calling itself by the color that the band wears? For that matter, how can we even stand to live in America, seeing as how the band plays our national anthem? Let’s blow up this planet! It’s where the band lives. Well, so long. I have to go to my tone-deaf dog’s recital.

Sincerely,

Dan Gati.

Thanks, Dan. We appreciate your quote-unquote criticism. But we have one question: do football players go to job interviews dressed as they are for football games?

Watch now as the Band forms a quote-unquote band and plays a school spirit quote-unquote song to enliven the quote-unquote crowd.

:sd[Band forms amorphous blob with quotation marks around it, and plays "Brown Cheering Song."]

OK, OK. By now, you’ve ALL heard about the Brown grad student who tried to poison his ex-girlfriend with radioactive iodine. But frankly, we don’t see why people are making such a big deal about it. Heck, people poison each other with radioactive iodine all the time at _Columbia_. You just don’t notice, since the entire New York metropolitan area is radioactive. So please, get a half-life! Besides, we can think of better ways to kill OUR lovers. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Brown Band proudly presents…:sd[drumroll]…Fifty ways to kill your lover! Here are the top six:

:::script-list

- A) Hit ‘em in the back. Crack!
- B) Hit ‘em with a van, Stan.
- C) Throw ‘em off the bus, Gus.
- D) Have them ski into a tree, Lee.
- E) Attack ‘em with a secret stealth bombing ploy, Roy.
- F) The Princeton Band!

Watch now as the Band forms a bottle of radioactive iodine and contaminates the field by playing "Spill Out."

:sd[Band forms bottle, spills radioactive iodine on the field, and plays "Sell Out."]

We now interrupt this halftime show for a commercial break.

Hi. I’m Senator Al D’Amato, and I’m here to talk about an exciting new product for the people of New York. Are you tired of the stench of polluted air and water? Too lazy to get off the couch and do something about it? Well, who needs the EPA, anyway? Not us! Instead, try my new deodorant, Columbia Roll-On! Just spread some on, and you’ll never have to notice pollution again!

New Jersey may be the nation’s armpit, but New York needs Columbia Roll-On!

Watch now as the Band forms a B, for blighted beaches, and plays "Garbage Bag Time."

:sd[Band forms B, plays "Ragtime."]

That’s all for today. Join us next week as the Band takes on its final exams. As for football, see you next year!

**_RUN AWAY!!_**
