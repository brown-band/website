## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that got rid of its last cello player just six months ago, it’s the Brown University “No Strings Attached” Band!

:sd[Band runs onto field, forms a football, and plays whatever it’s gonna play.]

So, ladies and gentlemen, we’ve learned that President Clinton recently visited Brown Stadium, and now we’d like to ask all you Brown fans: are _you_ sitting in the hot seat? While you contemplate that, watch now as the Band forms its favorite type of letter and plays Indecent Relationships Forevermore.

:sd[Band forms a B and plays #3.]

:sd[Band shifts B over ten yards and plays the Spam Splattered Banana.]

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, presenting an organization that is under the care of the Federal Witness Protection program, it’s the Yale “Under Lock and Key” Precision Marching Band!

:sd[Band skulks onto field.]

With all of the terrorist bombings of late, the organization formerly known as the Brown Band, which formed an exploding BMW in one of its previous shows, decided it would be wise to go undercover by taking on an alternate identity...

To do this, we had to send a member of the Band on a secret mission to New Haven. :sd[007 voice.] Her name was Band. :sd[Pause.] Jane Band. :sd[Mock-dramatic, mystery novel narration.] To prepare for the infiltration, she donned a navy blazer, dumped some extra starch into her underwear, and kissed her lover goodbye - because after all, she was going to New Haven and was not sure if she’d ever return.

Being the well-funded bandie she was, she stowed herself away in the UHaul of a returning Yale student. Deciding to start her research into the life of a real Yalie, she started to rummage through the suspicious-looking paraphernalia in search of band contraband. However, among the wardrobe of varying shades of dark navy blue blazers (all embroidered with the insignias of various secret societies), she found only one thing that might distinguish this person as a Yale bandie: an LP which contained nothing but bad 70s music. Watch now as the “Yale” Band forms a record and plays “Bulldog Inferno.”

:sd[Band forms record, rotates, and plays “Disco Inferno.”]

As she listened to the record with dread in her heart, socks in her shoes and that darn starch in her underwear, she began to chafe. After applying the crunchy cheese-baked scrod to soothe her sensitive skin, the U-Haul creaked to a stop. Man, that transition stunk, she said to herself. So she went to check the transition fluid. Failing to see a problem, mostly because of the New Haven smog, she continued on in her story.

Wearing her navy blazer, effectively disguising her true identity, she was immediately swept up into world of the Yale Underground. She entered the Vault, swiftly confronted by the KGB- the Killer Gumby Band. She was taught the ways of the KGB and by quirk of fate sent back to probe the :sd[loaded pause] minds of the Brown Band Think Tank, to find out just what their mysterious buttons meant.

The KGB, however, used something a bit more devious then a U-Haul to send her on her way - they unveiled their top secret ICBM - an intercollegiate ballistic missile, complete with passenger-side airbag and antilock brakes. Watch now as the Yale Band forms an ICBM and sends off Jane from Yale, with love, as she is headed For Bruno and For Brown.

:sd[Band forms ICBM, plays #4]

We thank Jane for joining us today -- she just landed in time to inform us of the secrets of the Yale Band’s Intelligence Division. It didn’t take long. Her debriefing was brief, and the chafing finally ceased. Therefore, the Band just underwent training on how to act like the Yale “Precision” Marching Band.

There were a few other things that we had to learn before we could come out here and successfully act like the Yale Band (because Killer Gumbys don’t just walk funny).

:::script-list

- A) We all had to do the starch in the underwear thing. It’s the only way to walk correctly. But thank God I’m up here, because obviously I don’t have to wear starch in my underwear to read a script like the Yale Band…
- B) The script-reader, that’s me, had to dump extra starch in his underwear too. Wait a second. No I didn’t. Oh wait. No. No. No. Aaaaaahhhhhhh! Ohhh…that tickles… stop that!
- C) To form a music library, we had to form the Big Bad Bruno Musicological Junta. I don’t understand either.
- D) We tried to gather a great deal of sea life to float around us during the half-time show. Octopuses, shrimp, stuff like that. But then we realized that this was silly and no band that was going for respectability would have squid-like things floating around.
- E) We called the Motherland and spoke with Yeltsin’s recent nominee for Foreign Minister, who happened to be the former head of the KGB. When asked how to be a real killer gumby, he seemed slightly confused. :sd[Russian voice] “Vhat ees dis keeler Gumbee you tolk of? Eet makes no senze.” I guess he was a different KGB head. Or maybe he was just covering for the Skull and Bones society.
- F) The Princeton Band

:::

Though Jane escaped her mission unscathed, save a bit of rough skin, we’d like to contemplate what might have happened if the KGB, doubling as the other Yale Band, had found her out. Watch now as the Yale band sends its demonstration of the domino effect back to Brown in the form of a vamp and plays Stand Up Mambo.

:sd[Band forms B, collapses upon itself (while drum line is at top of B, playing the vamp, not falling) and plays Speak Up Mambo]

We thank you all for joining us today. Join us in two weeks when we head to the swamps of Rhode Island to battle the URI band

:sd[Band gets the heck off of the field]
