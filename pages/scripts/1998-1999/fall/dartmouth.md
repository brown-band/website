# Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, uncles and aunties!\
Friends and alumni, grandpas and grannies!\
We proudly present a grupulous group\
That will wow you all down with a hearty ka-zoop!\
So all of you fans, let’s give them a hand!\
It’s the Brown University “Buppulous” Band!

:sd[Band gallops onto field, forms champagne glass.]

And now the Band offers a mighty big thanks\
Some hugs and some kisses, some kicks and some spanks\
To all the big seniors who are going away\
Their time of departure: some morning, next May\
So watch as the Band forms a big glass of bubbly\
And toasts all the seniors, right on the doubly.

:sd[Bits and Pieces]

First there’s Barb Green, who carries her sheep\
Everywhere—on the bus, on the field, in her sleep.\
She feeds us with Twizzlers, she wears her long tail\
A most loyal bandie, who’s here without fail.

From the state of New York comes a banger named Adam\
The Band has been glad for the four years we’ve had him\
While he is with us, he bangs on the snare\
And gives loyal athletic support to the Bears.

For the purpose of verse, we’ll call him Mike Zwarge\
Which is helpful: he’s tall, not to mention he’s large.\
He like-a to swing, he teaches us all,\
It’s Michael Zwarg—“Whaddaya mean it’s last call?”

Now we have Persky, whose first name is Jon\
A bandie so long that his liver’s half gone\
He’s not here today, due to overexhaustion\
But John Persky, we hail thee with loyal devotion.

Lastly, a bandie who knows what a flask’s for\
She writes papers about us—what more could we ask for?\
Our illustrious student conductor, it’s Kate\
She keeps us in rhythm, and what’s more, she makes sure we start and finish on time—oh, wait…

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, daddies and mommies,\
Friends and alumni, fascists and commies,\
Presenting an organization that toots\
On clarinets, trumpets, kazoos, and some flutes.\
And so, without further ado, give a hand\
To the Brown Unversity “Air-Breathing” Band!

:sd[Band charges field.]

And now let’s pay tribute to Newton K. Gingrich\
He’s finally done with Congressional flings, which\
Will leave him quite free to go where he may\
And we’re mightily glad that he’s going away!\
But where will he go? And how will he travel?\
Perhaps he will ride on a bear that eats gravel.\
Perhaps he will go to the North on the backs\
Of two or three Nibbulous North-Going Zax.\
Or maybe he’ll travel a river-y route\
And swim to Pa-Wunk in a pinstriped wetsuit.\
Or tour the far-FAR-away Land of Lazarmy.\
And perhaps he will take with him Richard K. Armey.\
Watch now as the Band forms a Congress sans Newt\
And plays the song “Aqualung” as a salute.

:sd[Band does this.]

We’ve heard that the companies Pepsi and Coke\
Are competing for rights to make Dartmouth folks broke.\
But who really wants either one of those colas?\
They kill your digestion and rot out your molas.\
They eat up your liver and waltz with your spleen…\
Oh, we could go on till two-thousand-nineteen.\
And who says that money and corporate leverage\
Should determine a campus’s choices of beverage?\
And so we would like to bring onto the scene\
A new type of drink for the folks at Big Green.\
Its name shall be “Moose Juice.” From that, please deduce\
That Moose Juice is simply the juice of a moose.\
Its flavor is moosey. Its color is spruce.\
It’s endorsed by one Thickwit, the Green-Hearted Moose!\
Watch now as the band forms a moose’s long :sd[half a beat] antler,\
And plays “Pepsico Inferno” before we dismantl’er.

:sd[Band does this too.]

And now for this segment, a quick dedication\
To thirty great years of Band coeducation.\
It all started back in the year ’68\
When some poor Brown Bandie could not find a date.\
So instead of pursuing the street corner strumpet\
He sought out the girls who knew how to play trumpet.\
He ended his search, he came back with fifty\
All playing instruments varied and nifty.\
There was May-Betty-Lou on the didgeridoo,\
And Lola-Lee-Looka who played the kazoo.\
On afuge-cabasa, twas Sue-Patty-Lee,\
And a Fluble horn handled by Ellen Marie.\
Watch now as the Band toots away on their horns\
And forms a large B for the Brown Women Born.

:sd[Band forms B, plays BMB.]

That’s all for today, so we’ll now be bye-byein’\
Join us next week as we take on the Lions.

:sd[…And we step off to Ever True.]
