Dear ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, today's gonna be a great day, and here's why! Presenting an organization that never throws away its shot, it’s the Brown University “Spoiler alert: Hamilton dies in Hamilton” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

For the first time in forever, we're back out on the ice! Although something seems a little off… these aren't the band kids that we know and have learned to live with. We've become the only thing even more terrifying–theater kids, and we’re excited to visit Union College in New York! Broadway, here we come! Wait a minute… where are the crowds and obnoxious neon signs? Too late, we realize we’ve arrived in… Shenectady? Skenectaydy? Schadenfreude? Whatever! Watch now in antici… (Band: Say it! Say it!) Pation! As the band forms (something New York) and plays "Too late, we realize…"

:sd[Band forms X and plays Time Warp.]

The cursed children of Union College are sorted into seven Minerva Houses, but we think that’s not enough! We've got a little list of suggestions for new ones:

:::script-list

- A. House Holbein, where no one wants a waist over nine inches
- B. House Toulon, where the students are safe behind stars–this we swear by the bars!
- C. House Garnier–stay away from the sewers!
- D. House North Shore, where on Saturdays, we wear brown
- E. House Jets and their rival, House Sharks, and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band forms an X and plays "Band Like Me."

Attend the tale of Sweeney-comma-John, who showed up at a Union frat party one night and probably caused more destruction than a certain other Sweeney! Let’s hope he didn't bake any Alpha Delta pie… Though with how many fraternities it has, Union probably wouldn't miss one. I could probably found one right here and now! What, like it’s hard? Watch now as the band forms a B for Broadway and plays "One Fray More."
