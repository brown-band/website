Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that Old person voice . . . er, what was I saying again? It's the Brown University "So I played with my instrument on ice, which was the style at the time" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

You prim and proper folks in the audience don't need to worry about our devious, dirty minds today. This is an all-ages show–by which we mean bandies of all ages are performing, from the dustiest, mustiest crusty to the most fresh-faced baby bear. Welcome our alumni back to the Perelman Arts District! And, you know, the rest of campus. Crack your joints, gather around in Fulton Hall, and watch now as the band forms a walker and plays "Guess What? We're Baaaaaack!"

All right, that’s enough of the old crusties! Datamatch? What’s that? All the hip kids on the Princetonian block use Marriage Pact, where an all-knowing, all-seeing AI pairs students up with their partners for life. Now there’s no need to worry about the fickle whims of hookup culture or desperate nights crying alone in a corner–just do what the computer says and you’ll be fine. The computer is your friend. Trust the computer. Watch now as the band overthrows its robot overlords with a heart-shaped polycule and plays "On Valentine’s We Touch."

Hey, who let a bunch of Princeton students in the scriptwriting room? Aren't you supposed to be rushing eating clubs right now? We love our crusties! And to show it, let's take a trip down memory lane and regale you with a brief history of the band’s favorite forms:

:::script-list

- A. A delicious banana and two juicy grapes
- B. A cairn to guide crusties around the new buildings–what’s a “Lindemann”?
- C. A gavel to litigate messy bandcest divorces
- D. A shovel to dig the graves of our eldest bandies
- E. A very loooooooooong island with a questionable shape and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band barely edges the climax of the joke and plays "Giving Me Fray Hairs."

:sd[Band counterskates into a B and plays In the Fray.]

Kids these days! Brown Band Out.
