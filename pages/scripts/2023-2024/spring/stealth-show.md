Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s finally worth your $300,000, it's the Brown University "Are we late for Spring Weekend?" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We know how much you all love Undertow, so what could be a better use of the Spring Weekend funding than a second band? This decision came straight from a certain student group, so you know it's a good one. It seems like the stage is a bit smaller than we expected, and I thought there might have been more lights, but no matter what, we're right on time to perform! _second person whispers_ What's that? _second person whispers_ Uh oh.

Watch now as the Band reorganizes its Google Calendar and plays "Litter Flies."

Now that the excitement is over, it's time for the Band to hit the Sci-Li. Or the Rock, if you're a civilized human being. We've got so many different classes to study for, and here's just a few of the ones holding us up.

:::script-list

- A. NEUR 0420: Cognitive Effects of Recreational Flora
- B. CLPS 0069: Cunning Linguistics
- C. ECON 0000: Budgeting with UFB
- D. URBN 0123: The Industrial Organization of Sesame Street
- E. PHIL 1576: Look it up! and
- F. The Princeton band

Load up the pre-med cannons, teeter on the edge of an S/NC, and watch now as the Band plays "It's Going Down (My GPA)"

We have something very special to show you. You may have noticed that our baton is rather engorged. It's so voluptuous, in fact, that it might just be the biggest one in the world. We're having it examined by experts. And we do in fact know how to use it–introducing the all-new Brown Band Symphonic Players with a delightfully classical little tune for y'all.

Watch now as the Band embraces musical tradition and plays "Araby's Daughter."

This one's for you, John Diamond. Brown Band Out.
