## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that KNOWS that they got that dog in them, it’s the Brown University “Body of a Chihuahua, Spirit of a Labrador” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We’d like to welcome the Yale Precision Marching Band, along with the lesser-known Yale Accuracy Marching Band. What do you mean, “What precision?” Those allegations are patently false and will not stand up to scrutiny! I’ve got all my sources right here, and I even translated some of them correctly! Watch now as the band starts an administrative revolution and plays “I Get My Info From Wikipedia”

:sd[Band forms an X and plays I Get Around.]

Still, with a university as old as Yale, there are surely going to be some prominent graduates. Among its alumni is America’s first spy, best known for setting the entire city of New York on fire and having the CIA try to steal a statue of him. Yale honors his memory with a trap worthy of a secret agent–if someone tries to carry on his firestarting legacy in the library, the outcome will take their breath away! Grab your oxygen masks, rappel out the window, and watch now as the band plays “Shippin’ Impossible.”

Catch us at halftime when we buy your mascot for $5.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that will never raise your taxes, it’s the Brown University “read my lips” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Inflation has been on the rise lately, huh? And no, I’m not talking about that giant bladderball. I mean, back in ‘05 you had to train a group of Capuchins to handle your finances! But just as quickly, they figured out that money can be exchanged for grapes and … services. Watch now as the band goes bananas and plays “Monkey Town.”

:sd[Band forms an X and plays Funkytown.]

We’ve heard of a lot of secret organizations over at Yale, and the Band’s top investigators have been sent to bring them all out into the open - here’s the ones we've found to exist:

:::script-list

- A. Skull and Bones, who are ready to take your Order
- B. Spade and Grave… at least for the next couple of days
- C. Mac and Cheese–keep an eye out for impastas
- D. Leaf and Handle… wait, that’s just our shopping list
- E. H and W, a society it takes 20 years to leave, and
- F. The Princeton band :::

Watch now as the band discovers what’s really in the tomb basements and plays “In the Fray-Masons.”

:sd[Band forms B and plays In the Fray.]

Go back to Hartford. Brown Band Out.
