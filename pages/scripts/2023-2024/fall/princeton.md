## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that is most certainly always on its best behavior, it’s the Brown University “No Mom, I stay in and study on the weekend” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

This is a special weekend - our families are finally able to tag along and witness what we get up to when we say “I’m with the band”, something they promised they wouldn’t do once we went off to college. Parenthood is truly a wondrous thing - which is why we’re so excited that the Princeton tiger and tigress were able to begin their journey towards parenthood, right on the football field. However it seems as though someone was not impressed with the quality of those … interactions, as they split not long after. We just hope the custody battle was amicable.

Drop your kids off for the weekend, and watch now as the band plays “That Tigress is a Mom!”

:sd[Band forms a cat and plays Stacy’s Mom]

Oh no! While we were playing, a certain professor used his mind-reading powers on the entire stadium! He’s hatched a dastardly scheme to extort students for all the secrets they’re keeping from their innocent parents! Only one man can stop him–the Dark Knight himself, returning to Princeton after graduating in whatever year comics count as the distant past this week! POW! WHAM! Watch now as the band sends out the band signal and plays “Build Me Up, Batarang.”

Ooh, my achin’ joints . . . Catch us at halftime when we’ve finally gotten our hip replacement.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that slaps you with school spirit, it’s the Brown University “can’t snooze this alarm” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

We love our campus traditions - and we think that everyone should be able to enjoy waking up at 8:00 in the morning with us! There’s nothing like school spirit, and Princeton students have no shortage of ways to show theirs. Clean up some… totally non-alcoholic stains with your senior jacket! Duel your RA on Nassau Street! And of course, try not to fall off the roof while stealing the Nassau Hall bell clapper. (Pause) Ooh, that was a nasty one. Let’s just hope y’all don’t have any torsion from that!

Wipe off the dust, and watch now as the band plays “The Lacerations that I Get”

:sd[Band forms X and plays Impression.]

We truly appreciate all of our bandies, from our quietest flute to our loudest cymbal. The Princeton Band clearly does too, giving out a bunch of exciting awards every year. Here are some of our favorites:

:::script-list

- A. The Turkey of the Year award, given to the band member who has exercised the worst judgment (such as choosing to play trumpet)
- B. The Freshman Lush, awarded the “Little Whizzer” for best establishing the spirit of the - band after drinking… lots of milk, Mom
- C. The Grossest Member… I think this one explains itself
- D. The “What’re you Doin’ in There?” Award, given to the two band members who spent the most time “reorganizing the band closet” together.
- E. The “Presidential Attitude,” the award given to the bandie who has consumed the most “Jimmy Carter’s” in one sitting and
- F. The Princeton band :::

Still, all these awards have nothing on the prestige of the Brown Band’s very own Dochebag Award. Watch now as the band engages with our bandie siblings from another state’s traditions and plays “Raise Your Grossest Glass”

Your Dad. Brown Band Out.
