## Pregame
Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization with a very talented woodwind section, it’s the Brown University "Quick Fingering" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

I have to say, Harvard, you sure do have a beautiful campus! I guess it’s not for nothing that you have the largest academic endowment in the world. Your large endowment results in beautiful erections like the Widener Library–and the Cage has aroused our interest even further! Watch now as the band forms a cage and reaches the pinnacle of its performance with "Bad Romance"!

:sd[Band forms cage and plays Bad Romance.]

Catch us at halftime when we can really take our time with things.


## Halftime
Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that had to try really hard not to mention some of your alumni, it’s the Brown University "it’s always the trombones" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Harvard prides itself on tradition; it’s so traditional, in fact, that one of the staff members took a tip from med students in the Victorian era! Somehow, this is still only the second weirdest dismemberment incident at Harvard–sorry, Mr. Parkman. Thank goodness they tore down the old Gore Hall, or we’d have a bloody mess on our hands in more ways than one. Get ready for a visceral show as the band forms a shovel and plays "Grave Robbing Song"

It feels like your mascot is getting a little on in years - it might be time to finally send John the Pilgrim to the retirement home. Here’s a couple replacement options we thought up:

:::script-list

- A. The bugs that share their dorm rooms with Harvard students
- B. RISD’s mascot–you’d have to lock that one in the Cage
- C. An elephant, since goes so well with crimson already
- D. Yet another bear mascot Ivy League School
- E. A turkey, with the added suggestion of changing your name to "The Harvard Gobblers" and
- F. The Princeton band

Unfortunately, like most other pilgrims this one is probably here to stay, so watch now as the band plays "Permanent Residence in the USA"

:sd[Band forms Pilgrim Hat and plays Party in the USA.]

You know, we really respect your motto of "Veritas." Harvard professors have always upheld this standard of integrity, and a certain business professor even recently conducted a study on dishonesty! It’s good to see people backing up their claims with well-researched data. Watch now as the band forms our most straightforward form and plays "Commitment 2 Honesty"

:sd[Band forms a B and plays #2.]

John Wiest, this was for you. Brown Band Out.
