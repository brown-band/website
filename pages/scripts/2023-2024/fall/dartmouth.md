## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that always shows up to important band traditions, it’s the Brown University “Error 404: Seniors Not Found” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

My fellow Brunonians, we were going to invade Dartmouth for its bountiful resources, such as lots of grass and sheep. However, none of our seniors showed up for conscription day. Now we’ll have to draft percussion instead, and all they can do is hit things with sticks. Watch now as the band executes Operation Dartmouth Storm and plays “Joshua went to Trader Joe’s.”

Catch us at halftime, when we celebrate the election of zero trumpets to band board.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that built the world’s first indoor amphitheater, it’s the Brown University “music playing band” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Fire. All there is, fire. Where humanity began, where it will one day return. The road not taken, why? The world shall perish twice. Once in red fish, once in blue fish, once in green eggs and ham. (Drawn out and passionate) Writhe. (Beat)

Watch now as the band celebrates homecoming by melting Robert Frost and performs a live reading of “Through the Fire and Ice.”

You know, as much as we love making fun of you, Dartmouth, we’re more alike than you think! Here are some of our favorite things our schools have in common:

:::script-list

- A. The grassy greens play a vital role in our students’ lives
- B. Our mascots have gotten a lot smaller over the years
- C. We both are overly devoted to a color
- D. Our bands love to form D’s on the field
- E. EEEEEE and
- F. The Princeton band

Watch now as the band forms our favorite form and plays “Dii Theme.”

To honor our soon-to-be-crusty seniors, we have decided to throw prose to the wayside in favor of anapestic trimeter. (Band: I hardly know ‘er!). First comes the champagne, then comes the back pain! A toast to our beloved Brown bandie buddies:

This goes out to the man with a stache,\
Who in ten years will make loads of cash\
He’s in Guiness’s book,\
And our hearts he has took,\
And his time here was done way too fast\

There once was a man with long hair,\
Who later would shave his head bare.\
Our lovely conductor\
And music constructor\
Has endless compassion to share.\

Shaw sure is a guy that exists\
Too many rehearsals he’s missed\
Can’t fill out a form\
Must be asleep in his dorm\
Here’s a message for him: Catch these fists!\

This one’s for the guy who takes pics\
As we march, we hear camera clicks\
Melodica player,\
He’s always a slayer,\
Without him, we’d be in a fix\

:sd[Band forms a champagne flute and plays Bits and Pieces as the limericks are read.]

Our seniors have spent so much of their time here playing with us on the field (because what else would you do on Saturday?). We’re giving them a chance to really let all their marbles out, and after four years with us, they’ve sure got a lot of them! On three! One, two–

:sd[Band forms their favorite form and plays their favorite song.]

Fall. Band Band In.
