## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization on the verge of inventing the wheel, it's the Brown University "Grug think big! Grug smash!" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Welcome to Rhode Island, URI! Wait a minute . . . Anyway, you don't have to worry about us making fun of your school today. We'd never sink so low, especially considering the Titanic discoveries one of your professors has made! It's a good thing no one's ever taking that deep a dive into history again, right? Watch now from the lifeboats as the band forms a hungry crustacean and plays "Don't Feed the Lobsters!"

Speaking of feeding animals, congratulations on the newly-established agriculture program! Farming is an industry that often goes underappreciated, but we think that recent developments in Rhode Island have really helped aspiring farmers make some green. I love the smell of a good plant in the morning–smells like you're livin' the high life! Watch now as the band forms a B and plays "Green Man Born."

Catch us at halftime, when we play till the rams come home!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's the pride of New England, it's the Brown University "this island ain't big enough for the two of us" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Let's take a second to appreciate all of URI's unique, storied, completely original traditions! Like the Nearly Naked Mile, where college students run around naked–hold on. Okay, then how about Oozeball, where players get down and dirty in the mud–no, that one's from UConn. Ah! Finally! A tradition that's truly URI, an annual music festival that celebrates the university's musicians and artists! Just, uh, don't ask what it's called. Watch now as the band forms an L and plays "Hips Don't Lie," a completely original song by URI.

Unfortunately, it seems as though URI's fallen on hard times. They've resorted to renting out their own mascot just to make ends meet! Here's just some of the things you can purchase Rhody's services for:

:::script-list

- A. A 21st birthday - he's always the life of the party
- B. Saying "Good one, boss" after all your jokes
- C. Crying at your funeral
- D. Jumping out of a cake at a bachelor party
- E. Disposing of uppity rival mascots and
- F. The Princeton band

:::

Make sure to keep Rhody in his original clothes, and watch now as the band forms a fluffy little guy and plays Starsheeps.

Well, at least we didn't bring up Butterfield Hall this time! Brown Band Out.
