Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization whose jokes are as original as your mascot, it's the Brown University "take the bulldog by the horns" BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

It's easy to forget just how wild people can get at their first football game of the year. I guess that's what you get when your pep band plays a song called "Bryant Fight." Still, as long as there aren't any bottles getting thrown on the field, we feel pretty safe here. After all, this is the #1 safest campus in America, according to an article so reputable they misspelled the word "seventeen!" Grab the university mace, get up in the stands, and watch now as the band plays "Is anybody here a doctor?"

Bryant University is in the top 1% of return on investment for colleges, and they sure are proud of it! No one comes out higher than Bryant students _cough_ _cough_! Here are some of the historic positions past Bryant alumni have gone into:

- D. Lacrosse player for the Long Island Lizards, a real sports team that exists,
- E. Capitalist drone at the Fidelity building across the street, and

Here's a look into your future, kids! Watch now as the band plays "Time Warp To Two Years After Graduation."

Regardless of the many other locations that you have occupied, we remember when you were located on College Hill as well, and then you left us for Smithfield! You may have taken the arch, but we got Fulton in the divorce. I guess that's not too surprising, since you spent a decade in debt and had literally one dollar in the treasury. Watch now as the Band plays "Had to Cash out my 401K"

Get Krupped. Brown Band Out.
