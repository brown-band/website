## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that doesn’t understand why you would want a ton of warts, it’s the Brown University “The economy isn’t real” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD!

Coming from a school that doesn’t even have a business major, it’s refreshing to see someone cares about the future of the hedge fund industry. Luckily Penn students get experience with moving the goalposts before they even graduate!. Still, if you’re rich enough from daddy’s emerald mines, you, too, can become a corporate oligarch. So watch now as the band forms a shiny gem and plays “Ra, Ra, Racketeer.”

:sd[Band forms Emerald and plays Rasputin.]

Catch us at halftime when we use our athletics budget to buy Kik.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that for some reason can’t see their reflection, it’s the Brown University _spoken in a Dracula accent_ “blah blah blah” BANNNDDDDDDDDDDD

Since it’s Halloweekend, we thought we’d give you all a good scare! Here are some of the most terrifying things about Penn:

:::script-list

- A. If you step on the compass, a plague of locusts descends upon you
- B. The cold, dead eyes of your mascot
- C. The wrath of an enraged pacifist
- D. ENIAC, the Evil, Never-Inhibited Annihilation Computer
- E. The probability of indictment on the year of your 55th reunion, and
- F. The Princeton band :::

We can’t tell if you’re screaming in fright or because it’s midterm season! Either way, uncover your eyes and watch now as the band plays “October”!

:sd[Band forms a pumpkin and plays September.]

We’d like to propose a toast–no no, wait, don’t throw it yet! A toast to the iron moral backbone of Penn’s students and faculty, and to their perfect ratio. At Penn, you’ll never find “Sine moribus vanae.”

Watch now as the band plays “Toast 2, toast 1’s better half”

:sd[Band forms B and plays #2.]

Wait a minute, this isn’t Penn State. Brown Band Out.
