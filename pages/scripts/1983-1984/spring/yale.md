Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Preppies from Haven, presenting the Brown University “Not Dressed Up But Someplace To Go” Band!

No, we don’t <u>all</u> have mono. We were out late last night celebrating the University “Winter Slush and Mud Carnival” Weekend, which is just like Winter Weekend because it, too, does not really exist. The highlight of the weekend will be tomorrow when there will again by hot tubs on the ice, along with a glass of champagne and a complimentary dose of penicillin. Also to be introduced then will be a new drink: the “Big Brew-In Special,” whose recipe just happens to match Yale’s 1983 football record: 1 part tonic to 9 parts gin. The Band salutes the new beverage by emptying a glass on the ice and playing “Yes! We Don’t Drink Much Tonic.”

Turning our attention to the Post Office, we now welcome the electronic billboard; truly an all-purpose device. With it you can: :sd[Second voice, which sounds like a Ronco commercial, reads the parts in quotation marks] learn the news—“U.S. Invades Rhode Island,” send messages—“Stay away from my wife! Love, Buddy,” and advertise—“Be a New England Tech graduate, or compete with one!” Incidentally, this show has been sponsored by Golf Digest: six issues for just $9.97. The Band now brings the electronic age to the ice and plays “Billboard March.”

And now, the Band concludes its 15th season on skates. Be back in September when a goal will be worth 3.
