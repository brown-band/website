Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you athletic supporters, it's the official band of the 1984 Olympics!
</sp>
<sp>
Yes, the Sarajevo games are almost upon us, and Brown students are hard at practice preparing for some of the most grueling events ever attempted by Ivy Leaguers. Here's Roxanne DeFloozy, our representative to the Walking Safely Through Wriston Quad competition. And here's Harold McNerd, who is going for the gold in Taking Finals Without A Reading Period--what a brave lad. Say hello to Brown Band member Joe Shmoe - he's competing in the dangerous and grueling sport of Target Booting. And, of course, please welcome Francine Mulligatawny, entered in both the Ratty Survival contest and the Financial Aid Obstacle Course. Watch now as the band salutes the commercial aspects of the games and plays ABC's "Wide World of Shorts."
