## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you stuffed shirts and stuffed resumes, it’s the Brown University, “Hire a Senior,” Band!

As we salute our seniors in this, their last football game, we are reminded that, while we remain at Brown, our senior colleagues must soon return to that terrible world of reality. Parents, Friends, Alumni, we appeal to you as potential employers. Please recognize that not all Brown students are engineers or computer scientists, and of this small remaining fraction, some are not going to graduate or professional schools. The band now salutes those Brown pre-meds who were not accepted to medical school this year, and plays, “That Magnificent Seven Percent.”

Friends, when you hire, we urge you to consider a Brown Band approved, Brown University Bachelor of Arts. Think of the many attributes guaranteed to be found in the portfolios of each of these fine candidates.

:::script-list

- a) Patience. They have endured four years of Brown athletic failure.
- b) Intestinal fortitude. They have endured four years of the Ratty.
- c) Intellect. Their minds have been painstakingly trained and refined through the rigors of Engin. 9, Geo. 1, and any course counting towards organizational behavior.
- d) A witty and clean sense of humor. They have been members of the Brown Band.
- e) Make that a witty sense of humor, and,
- f) The Princeton Band has not nearly a fine a group of seniors as those who stand before you today.

The Band now kicks its seniors off the back of a band bus, onto the New Jersey Turnpike of life.

Hey, it’s a tough world out there. Good Luck!

## Halftime

:sd[Band marche out backwards on yard lines, plays “Ever True”]

Now,once again it is the time\
 To do our halftime show in rhyme.\
 Let’s show the wonders of Brown U.,\
 And talk about Columbia, too,\
 We’ll wax poetic for a bit,\
 Dispensing with out usual....junk.

Howard Swearer is now our prez;\
 We all know theirs—he’s Juan Valdez.\
 They’ve got better coffee, and, alas,\
 Columbia grows nicer grass.\
 But they’ve gone downhill – do you wonder how?\
 They play home games in Jersey now.

Remember at Columbia last year?\
 The band “took the field” and brought it here!\
:sd[Band raises up remains of Baker Field]\
 So let’s salute old New York Town,\
 As they trek to Providence and lose to Brown.\
 A pretty formation, a fancy verse,\
 As we do our show in auto-reverse.

:sd[Band forms flower which becomes a revolving whirlpool]\
:sd[“Thunder and Blazes” → “1812 Overture”]

:sd[in Russian accent:] We have taken control of the microphone! We have set the band in revolution with music from the fatherland! Ladies and Gentlemen, bourgeoisie and proletariat, and all capitalist warmongers it is the Red University People’s Communist Band! Da!! The East Campus bloc has revolted and formed new progressive university. We are no longer band members; we are band comrades! We have nationalized our instruments to devote ourselves to distrust, injustive, and the Soviet way. Watch now as we form hammer and sickle on the field, salute our leader, and play “Yuri Grand Old Comrade.”

:sd[“You’re a Grand Old Flag”]

Ladies and Gentlemen, after the war there will be a postgame reception, at which all loyal comrades will recite correctly the following revolutionary developments:

:::script-list

- A) West
- B) Wriston Quad will become Red Square
- C) Providence shall be renamed “Buddy-grad”
- D) The Green is now the Red
- E) The Gate is now the Iron Curtain; and

:::

Also, our New New Curriculum will consist of one mandatory Mode of Thought course, and all students will be required to earn good Marx. Five-Year Plans for Semiotics majors shall continue, but the History and Creative Writing Departments will merge to form the Russian Studies Center, and Am. Civ. Will become the Department for Building Even Bigger Tractors. In addition, all UCS elections will remain uncontested. Watch now as the band performs Lennon’s favorite tune, “When I’m Sixty-Four, I’ll Still Love the Bolsheviks” Andropovs its imperialist garb to form a left wing on the field.

:sd[Band forms a wing and plays “When I’m 64”]

Comrades! Quit Stalin for time—be back this hockey season when the band will not be so revolting. Now, quick—Trotsky into exile before capitalist warmonger athlete-scholars return! :sd[Band runs off behind the bushes to complete yet another amazing football season.]
