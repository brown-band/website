Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you little Princetons and princesses, sit back and relax as you hear the tale of the Princeton and the Pauper, as told by the Brown University “hippyish and laid back” Band.

Once upon a time there was a pretty baby who grew into a prince, and, growing impatient waiting for his princess to come, decided to take matters into his own hands, and set out to find her. Unfortunately, he started his trek at College Hill Travel, and ended up in New Jersey. Although he was given a good room, our prince was forced to

:::script-list

- A) enroll at Princeton Community College
- B) room with seventeen reporters from the National Enquirer
- C) a Princeton Band uniform
- D) submit to constant all-nighters at his eating club, where he hangs around with a perpetually tired puss
- E) endure an endless love poetry course; and
- F) the Princeton Band

Traumatized, the prince cries a blue lagoon of alligator tears. Fearing that he will find neither his princess nor his desired degree in New Jersey, our spunky hero decides to forsake his Bean boots for bellbottoms, and sets out for Bruno and for Brown.

On his last trip to Providence, our prince was granted a royal tour, and even had a street named after him. It is the Main Hope of our Benevolent Angell to reacquaint himself with a John, but in Transit, he keeps Meeting Olney George and Thayer. Without Prospect of Benefit from these Sessions, the prince pauses to provide a commercial message: “If you go to Princeton, you lose a very important part of your 1ife. ”Unable to find a John , the prince despairs until his fairy godmother waves his magic wand, transporting our hero to Toad Hall. Amidst that pungent Ratty aroma, he kisses the toad and finds himself catalogued in isolation at the John Carter Brown library, where he lives happily ever after dreaming of his times spent in the fray at the GCB’s happy hour.
