You've heard about them. You've envied them at the yacht club. You were rejected by all of their schools. But get ready, 
because they're coming this way, postpaid from Freeport, Maine: it's....the Ivy League! Ladies and gentlemen, friends 
and alumni, and all you Nitty Wits, it's the Brown University "your coach is better educated than ours" Band!
</sp>
<sp>
Are you bored by today's game? Humiliated by unranked teams from central Ohio? Skunked by the Boston backfield? 
Well, the Brown Band would like to suggest a unique and competitive alternative to football - "Simon Says!" OK, 
all you Pennsylvania peons, let's play...Simon says give up your national ranking. Simon says recruit players 
whose weight exceeds their S.A.T scores. What does Nittany mean? Simon says B.C.-ted. Raise your right arm. You 
fans from Harrisburg, raise both right arms. Let Brown win. Oops, we didn't say "Simon Says." Oh well, in that 
case, we surrender. Watch now as the band forms a sizzling time bomb on the field, salutes today's football match-up, and plays "Mission Impossible."

And now, a word from our sponsor...Hi, I'm Albert Einstein. I helped make the atom bomb. You know, when I sit 
down to watch "The Dukes Of Hazzard" after a relatively long day, I like to pop open a frothing can of Heavy 
Beer, from Three Mile Island. It's got only 238 rems per can<smdash/>tests great, and less killing, too! It 
glows down real smooth, perfect for melting down after a long, hot day reacting to hard-core problems. Heavy 
Beer, the pride of Harrisburg<smdash/>take along a six pack next time you go fission.... And now, back to the 
Brown Band, as it theorizes an atom on the field, and melts down with "Hot Stuff".

<sd>Band forms atom with tubas as electrons and plays "Hot Stuff"</sd>

But seriously, folks, we'd like to thank you for letting us have our silly little fun here today in Wally Stadium...<sbr/>
Gee, Wally, I thought the field was named for me.<sbr/>
Sorry Beav, I've got better alumni connections.<sbr/>
Aw, shucks. What do you think, Eddie?<sbr/>
Quiet, you little squirt. I oughta...Oh, hello, Mrs. Cleaver, how are you today?<sbr/>
Just find, Edward. Wallace, did I hear you boys arguing about the football field again?<sbr/>
Yes, Mom. <sbr/>
Well, I'll tell you what. Your cousins Eldridge and Meat Cleaver are dropping by for lunch, and Auntie 
four-leaf Cleaver and Uncle Charlie Cleaver to block will be here, too. If you boys behave, we'll name 
an unranked, fourth-rate state college for each of you, alright?<sbr/>
Yay!<sbr/>
</sp>
<sp>
Good, now be quiet while the Brown Band forms a beaver on the field and plays "June Is Busting Out All Over" for me.<sbr/>
</sp>
<sp>
Surprised by our halftime show? Be back in two years, when we won't.
