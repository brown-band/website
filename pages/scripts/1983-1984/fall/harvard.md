From Providence, where a glance at the streets will convince you that it’s no longer a one-horse town, it’s Late Afternoon with David Letterband. Today; diminutive sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer, a visit to the Museum of the Hard to Believe, and viewer mail. And now, the only talk show host who still thinks 30 Rock is a carrel in the library, it’s the Brown University Da-vid LetterBand!

Thank you. My, we have quite an extravaganza here for you today, so let’s get started, shall we? You know, every Saturday afternoon since we first went on the field back in the late nineteenth century, we’ve been reading our viewer mail, and today is no exception. Our first letter is from a Mr. Tom Selleck of Hollywood, California. Tom writes: “Dear David; on your September 24 show I heard that band leader Sue Topchik’s favorite male swimwear is a Speedo bathing suit. Is this true? Well, Tom, I think it’s high time we found out, don’t you? Let’s give a great big hello to Brown Band President Sue Topchik—Sue?—My, we’re having some fun now, and while we’re at it, I’d like the Band to form the world’s largest doorknob on the field while we endure 25 or six too many commercials.”

The giant doorknob—it’s just plain big! And if that’s not enough, and gosh, don’t you think it ought to be, it’s time once again for a trip to the Museum of the Hard to Believe. My, it feels almost like a shrine in here. Our first exhibit is a Brown student who has actually sampled the Ratty’s shepherd’s pie and lived to tell about it. Here’s a fellow who went to Yale merely because he likes New Haven. Hard to believe. And here we have a Dartmouth student who doesn’t salivate when he hears a bell, and, finally, a Cornell undergrad who was actually accepted elsewhere. Simply amazing! And now, you’d better wake the kids and call the neighbors—let’s see if the Brown Band <u>can can</u> play the next song in less than one minute.

Well, that was certainly more fun than any three people should be allowed to have. Speaking of which, let’s bring out my next guest, a person who has appeared many times before on this very show, Dr. Ruth Westheimer.

“Hello, David still tossing pencils?”

Yes, and still catching them…We have a question here from a member of our stadium audience—“Dear Dr. Ruth; ever since I arrived at Harvard this fall, I’ve been frustrated. Ten thousand men of Harvard indeed! I’d settle for one who likes girls, but they all stay Cooped up in the Yard.” Signed, Crimson Cheeks.

> “Vell, usually I recommend that you do vhat you vant, as lonk as you got protection; but young lady, you’ve got the best protection in the worlt—a Harvard social life. Personally, I’d prefer a Hoosier vith a gap between his teeth. Vatch now as the Band forms David’d sexiest feature and plays ‘Get It On’.”

Be back in three weeks when we spank the bottom of the Ivy League.
