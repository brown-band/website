Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, Romans, and Countrymen: We come not to praise Penn, but to bury it. Direct from counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike, it’s the Brown University “the sword is mightier than the Penn” Band!

As we all Know, Brown University is named after Oxford University, but where did you guys get your name? Penzance? Did you come from Penn Station? Penn State? The Penitentiary? Were you products of Pennicillin? Penetration? Pennzoil? Were you featured in Penthouse? Were your parents Cross Penns? Pig Penns? Penguins? Or were you all just wee little Pennies from heaven?

Bored at the prospect of watching the Penn footballers fall yet again, the Brown Band searches for some stiffer competition, and enters itself into the Penn-American games. Our first event is the Pentathlon, consisting of duck-Penns, candlePenn bowling, the South Philadelphia O-Penn, Penn the tail on the Quaker, and sPenn the bottle. Unfortunately, all this exertion has given us a bad case of Penntathlete’s foot, not to mention aPenndicitis and the Penncreatic flu. The Band rushes off to seek medical help, but the only drugs available at the games are steroids. Needles to say, we took them, and flunked all our tests. Oh, well, do you think we’d look good in a moustache? Watch now as the Band grows a big one, right here on the doormat of the Ivy League, and plays “Hair, Hair, the Game’s All Hair.”

And now for your entertainment and delight, the Brown Band asks the following philosophical questions: If there were no people in Franklin Field today, would this Band show exist? If there were no one here and the Band went down in a drunken stupor, would it make a noise? Would it sound like “Gospel John”? If the Penn band had no instruments, would they sound better? If they had no members, how would they be able to blow their horns? Has Anita Bryant ever visited the City of Brotherly Love? How do you spell relief? Will words like \*\*\*\*\* and \*\*\* \*\*\*\*\* get past our censor? Aren’t you hungry? Which star is it? And what about Naomi? Does anybody really know what time it is?

Be back in two years, when you still won’t be able to hear a single word of this Band show.
