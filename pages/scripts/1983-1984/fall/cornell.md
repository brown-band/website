Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and a11 you freshman mothers and fathers, and their parents, presenting the only band you are encouraged to bend, staple, and mutilate, it’s the Brown University “wait—isn’t that a six pack on the fifty-yard line?” Band!

As you freshpeople have already noticed, you didn’t leave the joy of tests behind when you abandoned high school to attend Camp Bruno. This afternoon, the band springs a surprise quiz to see how you’ ve been making out against Brown’s stiffest competition. The first question on the Brown Social Aptitude Test is an analogy: Ralph is to Ratty as…

And now, here’s our second exercise-see if you can match the following famous celebrities with what they’ve said about the Brown Band:

Brooke Shields—“If you join the Brown Band, you lose a very important part of your liver.\
Our censor—:sd[band plays dischord]\
James Watt—“I <u>pity</u> da fool what don’t laugh at the Brown Band!”\
Mr. T.—“They don’t attract the wrong element; they <u>are</u> the wrong element.”\
The menu lady—“Today for your afternoon delight, we have fowl, nuts, and assorted fruits. Enjoy you halftime show.”\
Marcel Marceau—“:script-tab :script-tab”; and\
Dr. Ruth—“Dey’re very enchoyable. But ven you’re vith dem, you <u>must</u> remember to have alvays protection.”

Watch now as the band salutes parent’s weekend by forming a forbidden fruit on the field, and plays Copabanana.

Turning from college tests to testy calls, we remind you parents of those hard times earlier this fall, when your children phoned home in great despair. but things have been looking up Mom. Even though your son had a traumatic experience that first week without your homecooked buns, fear not—he’s been getting some regularly since then. And dads, even though your little princess was overwhelmed at first, you can rest assured she’s gotten on top of things since. And just because your son, on whom you’ve lavished hours of lessons, has ceased fingering his bow of late, doesn’t mean he’s lost his touch. But parents, we must be truthful and tell you that affairs at Brown aren’t always so bright. Just because your daughter’s grades started out in the high nineties, doesn’t mean they haven’t gone down since, and just because your son’s been out every weekend, doesn’t mean he hasn’t been stood up lately. Lest you think virtue is dead at Brown, the band forms a princess phone on the field and plays “Everything’s Coming Up No’s es.”

Be Bok in two weeks, when the band raises Harvard’s Derek.
