Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you pre-professional pugilists, it's the Brown University "Did you know they have plus-minus grading at Harvard, too?" Band!

Yes, fun-seekers, in the interest of longer lines outside the Sci-Li, larger group-all-nighters at the West Quad, and more of those tacky little primal screams, good old Camp Bruno may soon be doing its very best to drive us completely nuts. After all, why shouldn't we be able to fight tooth-and-nail for that extra half-gradeâ€”we're certainly paying enough for it. And besides, now we'll have even more chances to pass Engine 9 without doing any work! Now that's a free educational environment for you. Watch now as the band mourns the imminent demise of the New Curriculum, forms its favorite grade option on the ice, and plays "Plus-Minus Blues."

Be back next semester, when you'll wish you didn't have those four Incompletes to finish.
