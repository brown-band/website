No, wait—stay in the stands, please! Don’t leave. We’ll be good this time, we promise. Really. Just stay here and see how nice we can be. Thanks, we really appreciate it. Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you purveyors of fine halftime entertainment, it’s the Brown University “quality” Band!

> :script-tab Excuse me, but who’s on first?\
> Whaddya mean? This is a <u>football</u> game. You can tell because the number of players on the field never exceeds the mean S.A.T. scores at Holy Cross. Hey, did you know the baseball season ended last week?\
> :script-tab What?\
> Oh, he was the Secretary of the Interior, who also ended recently…\
> :script-tab Who?\
> Watt…\
> :script-tab Oh, never heard of him. What did he do?\
> Well, he tried to rid America of those pesky, annoying forests. Real dumb. We’ ve even written a commemorative song for him. Watch now as the band salutes the fall of a complete idiot, cuts itself down to size, and plays “Choppin’ Down the Woodside.”

Much as James Watt has been sidelined for being a naughty boy, the Brown Band has also been a bad, disrespectful bunch of snobby, spoiled, Mama’s little Buffys and Skips. Gosh jeepers, they ought to be spanked. Wait—here’s a better idea: let’s break into their computer account and edit their halftime show… there…

Wait a minute band. This show is supposed to be nice. Now go do what you’re told—clean up your act, and play “Rock Around The Mop,” just like cute little preppies.

We certainly hope that you’re enjoying our cuddly little salute to clean things; we’re sure trying! By the way, in case you fans are wondering how you can make your very own band show at home, here are some tips from our friendly neighborhood censor:

:::script-list

- A) If a formation is ten yards or more longer than it is wide, cut it.
- B) If the flutes move at all, get rid of it.
- C) If the students laugh at something and the alumni do not, there <u>must</u> be a hidden meaning somewhere.
- D) The words “Penthouse,” “alcohol,” and “Speedo” may not appear.
- E) The words “Sue Topchik” must be included in every show; and
- F) The Princeton Band may not be mentioned.

Watch now as we finally get some class into our act, make a sophisticated concert formation on the field, and play “Confessional From Show Wars.”
