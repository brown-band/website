Ladies and gentlemen, friends, buddies and alumni, and all you R.I. “N.E.”’s, presenting the only band capable of drowning on a bus from Providence to Kingston, it’s the Brown University “our tuition is bigger than your endowment” Band!

As a public service, the ever-civic-minded band today presents a course in water safety to the denizens of the Ocean State. Here are some initial precautions:

:::script-list

- A) Avoid swimming for at least one-half hour after eating to allow for digestion;
- B) Avoid swimming for at least one-half day after eating in the Ratty to allow for indigestion;
- C) Select a watering hole appropriate to your level of proFISHency;
- D) Different strokes for different folks--don’t feel that you must crawl if you have a hankering to do a breaststroke; and
- F) the Princeton Band

Our band, forever in over its head, rises off the band board and takes the plunge that refreshes, playing “Gonna Dive Now.”

Once in the swim of things, Rhode Island aquanauts should be careful to follow “the buddy system,” which tells us what to do in case of, for instance, a shark attack. If no lifeguards are to be found, a swimmer’s buddy should assault the shark through threats, a hex, torsion guns, or with simple everyday items such as fists or lighted cigarettes. As those who have tried it can tell you, when you attempt to thwart a predatory beast in May, or see ants eat your picnic in November, you will find “the buddy system” helpful in overcoming any adversary, with help from local guards, family or friends. Our paired-off band now forms a smoldering butt on the field, and plays “Come On, Buddy, Light My Fire.”

And speaking of fixing races, the Band turns its eyes toward Newport, where America’s Cup runneth over. With real Men At Work on a challenge from down under, new athletic supporters will be needed to keep the cup in American hands. Luckily, Hollywood has sent some help, including Howard Keel, Clara Bow, Soupy Sales, George Raft, and Wally Cox to block. Turning from A Cups to high cuts, the Band browses GQ and Vogue for beach fashion tips. Belts are in this year, which is fine for a band which never goes anywhere without a few stiff belts, The Band prefers one-piece this year, designs a suit high on the thigh, but finds itself unsuited in the end, so That Bear Band travels to Moonstone Beach, where the moon is always full, All this beaching has the Band well-prepared for some brown-nosing; watch now as we form Band President Sue Topchik’s favorite male swimwear and play “Everything’s Coming Up Speedo,”
