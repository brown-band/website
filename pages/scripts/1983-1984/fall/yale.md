Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Blue Weenies: If America had an official band, this would be it! Presenting the Brown University talent-free “never had it, never will” Band!

:sd[sings] Hold the pita, hold the platter, drink our booze and hold our bladders, all we ask is that you let us fast for a day.

Every summer many Americans choose to go without, in order that they may comfortably squeeze into their favorite hot-weather pastimes. But this year the national craze blew its own lid, as all of our favorite fast foods went without all their worthwhile ingredients. I mean, why not drink water if you can’t have the caffeine and sugar? What’s next-- an alcohol-free Brown Band? “The Dukes of Hazzard” without fast cars and Cathy Bach’s legs? Ed McMahon without Johnny? Tylenol-free protective bottles? How about Providence without Brown? Watch now as the band applauds this summer’s biggest rip-off, forms 6-, 9-, and 2000-piece boxes of chicken-free McNuggets on the field, salutes McDonald’s and you, and plays “Hot Sauce.”

Now, for the summer movie review! Since they were all bad, we have no features to show you, and we’d like to move right to the bulldogs of the week. The losers are: Trading Places, the story of Jennifer Biels in Flashdance; Class, a movie in which no Yale students appear; Risky Business, the thrilling and dangerous side effects of allowing Ronald Reagan to apologize for himself; and Octo-- …oh, never mind that one. Our choice for dog of the week is the Yale Bulldogs, for trying to imitate a football team. Watch now as the Band salutes these and other weak substitutes, and does its own flashdance in three-dee.

In its quest for intelligent life the band leaves New Haven to probe other black holes, in search of:

- D) No
- E) woks
- F) The Princeton Band, and

All we could find, however, through the Yale Observatory’s new “Return of the Eli” pocket spyglass was a big, fat, disgusting, slimy, slobbering Jabba the Putz and his vermin like protege Salacious Scum. Watch now as the Band forms its own telescope and searches the heavens for the ultimate “Star Wars” sequel.

Be back in two years when the Brown Band returns yet again, just for the tastelessness.
