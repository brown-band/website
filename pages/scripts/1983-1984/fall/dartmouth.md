Hanover, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Brown Band. Its four-year mission: to seek out new bars and 28 credits, to locate a woman at Dartmouth, to boldly form what no band has formed before— the amazing, inflating, triple-rotating, incredible marching slushball!!

:sd[Band comes out onto field into a slushball]

Today we’d like to salute the Brown-Dartmouth medical education program, in which young doctors-to-be begin their studies in beautiful Hanover, New Hampshire. Here they undergo two years of intensive vetinary training, and then head to Brown University for a real education. After all, how can you study female anatomy where there aren’t any live specimens? Speaking of which, did you ever wonder what happens to the alcohol they use to soak the dead bodies in med school? Well, perhaps you’d better have a closer look at the Dartmouth Band. And did you ever think about where they get those bodies from in the <u>first</u> place? Heh heh heh. Don’t look too carefully at their cheerleaders.

Watch now as the Brown Band plays “Yes, They Look Like Cadavers”, proposes a new green mascot for Dartmouth, and forms a gelatinous slime mold on the field.

:sd[Band forms amorphous blob and plays “Yes, We Have No Bananas”]

Speaking of slime, how about the Dartmouth Review? Well, we’d like to replace it with the new, unabridged Dartmouth Primer, written by noted animal expert Dr. Doolittle. Doc?...“Thank you. As you know, Dartmouth was formed in order to educate the Indians, but they all went to better schools. Anyway, for those who stayed here, I recommend a number of fun children’s games, such as Spin the Bottle, Spin the Cheerleader, and Pin the Quarterback on the Nervous Cheerleader. Sex education is important as well, but I’m not sure how much you Dartmouth students already know. How <u>are</u> your sex lives? :sd[Band yells “Boring!”] And, you must always remember your manners: This is a knife, and this is a fork. Sophisticated Ivy League students use them to consume food, or else they have to go to bed without any beer. This is sound advice, so you’d better <u>heed it</u>.”

:sd[Band forms knife and fork and plays “Beat It”]

Speaking of juvenile literature, how about the Dartmouth Review? You know, if we let those fanatics have their way, this cozy little <u>animal farm</u> of yours might have only six rules left by <u>1984</u>:

:::script-list

- A) All animals are created equal, but football players are more or less dumber than others
- B) Ignorance is strength
- C) I <u>will</u> drink harder
- D) Jack Daniels is watching you
- E) Two legs good, four legs better, and
- F) The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band gives up all hope for the future of Dartmouth, mourns its imminent departure from the Ivy League, and plays “Gonna Cry Now.”

:sd[Band forms two eyes crying and plays “Gonna Fly Now”]

Want to hear some really baaaaad jokes? Here comes the Dartmouth Band! :sd[Band forms two lines around entrance of Dartmouth Band]
