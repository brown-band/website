Traditions and institutions form an integral part of student life at Brown. Today we will introduce some of these traditions to the class of 1963.

With great pride, the Brown Band salutes the Department of Ceramics, Josiah B. Carberry, chairman. The skilful artists in this department have created many and varied treasures which may or may not perpetuate the name of Brown forever.

In recognition of the many joyous hours spent in leisurely dining at the Sharpe Refectory, where simple elegance is the keynote of each meal, the Brown Band salutes all those who have helped to make this adventure in fine dining possible.

Of the next salute, all that need be said is that its object is the king of beasts, that denizen of the jungle black, the best friend the Ivy League ever had — the Columbia Lion. Unfortunately, its impressive bark is not matched by its bite — due, perhaps, to a lack of the necessary equipment.

The final formation introduces a note of levity into this half-time show. At this point, the Band honors that organization which has done the most for and best embodies the spirit of Brown — that organization which the band feels has worn too long the mask of anonymity and trod too long beside, not on, the path of glory. Here, at last, is a salute to Brown’s finest Organization.
