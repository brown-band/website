The band has formed a blank check, which should be familiar to all you parents of Brown and Pembroke students. it seems that all this money winds up in one place — the guys spend it on their girls: the girls spend it on themselves. Nevertheless, we’re sure you’ll agree with us that <u>There’s Nothing Like a Dame</u>.
