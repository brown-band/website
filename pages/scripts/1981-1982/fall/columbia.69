Say, are you sure this show's been censored? Can we say that? No, of course it's not on. Listen: <sd>blows into mike, taps it a few times</sd>. See, you've got to push this button here if want... uh oh. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you trivia buffs, it's the Brown University "the answer to the last question of tonight's trivia contest is 'lummox'" Band! <sd>Band runs out onto field and keeps going, finally stopping and sitting down in the other end zone. Only one person remains on the field, having been trampled on. This person is attempting to recover.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Chuckle, chuckle</sd>. And you thought we were going to do a show today. Well, that's all we have time for... <sd>Solitary band person on field, as he/she comes to, examines the yard lines and then gets very excited, motioning the rest of the Band to come back out</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Wait a minute! I think there's something very unusual about these yardlines. <sd>Band storms back onto field, and begins snorting the yardlines, either on all fours or through their instruments</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Good stuff, huh? And how about those hash marks? Saluting its good fortune, the band forms a snowflake and plays "Gonna Fly Now". <sd>Band plays "Gonna Fly Now" after forming a snowflake.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Well, this is it. The last football formation of the year. What will it be? A submarine going into the bus tunnel? A salute to the Apollo-Soyuz linkup? A replica of the Washington Monument that grows? No! Something even better. Watch now as the band forms a cat in a microwave and plays "Kitty Kitty Bang Bang". <sd>The band forms a square with a cat inside and plays "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Be back next year when we'll clean up the mess. <sd>Band marches off to "Ever True", concluding yet another superb football season.</sd>
