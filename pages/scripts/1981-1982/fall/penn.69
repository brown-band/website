Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  We've received a special request from the Penn band to keep our show clean.  Well, we came here with a clean show, but it fell into the Schulkyl River, and now we can't be held responsible.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Pennie Loafers, we cleanly present the Brown University Band, sterilized for your protection!  <sd>The band runs out onto the field, acting clean and cute.</sd>

A clean show, huh?  No problem.  We can be clean.  We can be <em>squeaky</em> clean.  We can be squeaky, slippery slide...oh, sorry.  Watch now as the band forms a cute, clean smiley face on the field and plays "Put on a Happy Face."

Oh well, we tried.  Guys, we really did try to clean up our show.  We put it in the washer, but our off-color jokes were so fast that they didn't fade.  We tried putting it in boiling water, but the scum just floated to the top.  We tried scrubbing it, soaking it, but the alumni still got hot around the collar.  Perhaps we should have just taken a good hot bath.  But instead, we had to take a cold shower, because we forgot our rubber duckie.  <sd>The band forms a duck on the field and plays "Rubber Duckie."</sd>

You weren't serious, were you?  A <em>clean</em> show, in Philadelphia?  I mean, Penn is a four-letter word.  The classes here must be great.  On a clear day, you can see your professor.  The band salutes Philadelphia, forms the Liberty Bell, and plays "Greater Pittsburgh."  <sd>The band forms a bell, which cracks in the middle of "Greater Pittsburgh March."</sd>

Tired of pesky, rodent-like creatures with four-smelling breath and an ignorance of personal hygiene swarming all over <em>your</em> stadium?  Then I'd recommend looking away for the next six minutes.  <sd>The band marches off to "Ever True."</sd>
