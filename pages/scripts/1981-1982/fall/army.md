## Halftime

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.

:sd[The band marches out in three lines, dressed as preppies.]

The West Point Band will not be presenting a halftime show today, but we’re sure you all enjoyed their activities before the game. We in the Brown Band were particularly inspired by the cadets’ full dress parade, and so, ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you space cadets, we proudly present the Brown University Band Full Dress Parade! :sd[A drum cadence begins as the band marches into a dollar sign.]

Notice our Sperry topsiders... :sd[band shows off shoes] worn without socks... :sd[band shows off ankles] our Harris tweed jackets... :sd[band shows off jackets] and our alligator shirts. :sd[band opens coats and shows off shirts] This entire ensemble is available for a trifling five hundred dollars. :sd[The band takes out their wallets and throws fake money all around.]

Uh oh, band. It looks as if you haven’t been taking care of Daddy’s money. :sd[The band shakes its head.] Well, now that you’ve squandered your inheritance, Mummy is going to take away all your General Motors stock. :sd[The band drops to its knees and screams in agony.] That’s right, band. You had better pray for “Pennies From Heaven.”

And speaking of squandering money, the band looks at the defense department, and West Point. You know, West Point has come a long way. In 1980, it graduated its first woman. We can’t wait till it graduates its first man. Of course, some of those drill sergeants are pretty brutal. Watch now as the band forms a whip on the field and earns its stripes as it plays “Macho Man.”

Allright band, this has gone far enough. :sd[A drill instructor appears.] This show is ridiculous. It’s time to get serious. BAND! TEN...HUT! :sd[The band snaps to attention.] HUP...TWO...THREE...FOUR :sd[The band marches randomly.] LEFT...LEFT...LEFT, LEFT, LEFT. LEFT...LEFT...LEFT, LEFT, LEFT. :sd[The band acts accordingly.] BAND...HALT! :sd[The band halts.] FRONT...FACE! :sd[The band faces front.] INSTRUMENTS ...DOWN! :sd[The band puts their instruments down.] HANDS...UP! :sd[The band puts their hands on their stomachs and heads.] HUP...TWO...THREE...FOUR :sd[The band rubs their stomachs and pats their heads while marking time.]

LORDY BE I’M IN THE BAND,\
:sd[band: “LORDY BE I’M IN THE BAND!”]\
SURE AM GLAD THAT I’M A MAN!\
:sd[band: “SURE AM GLAD THAT I’M A MAN!”]\
SOUND OFF,\
:sd[band: ONE, TWO!]\
SOUND OFF AGAIN!\
:sd[band: THREE, FOUR!]

BRING IT ON DOWN NOW ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, ONE, TWO...THREE\
 FOUR. HALT! :sd[The band halts.] NOW DROP AND GIVE ME TWENTY! :sd[The band kneels and takes out money from their wallets which the drill instructor promptly collects.]

Now, ladies and gentlemen, to show you what we’ve learned, we proudly present the incredible Brown University precision drill formation! :sd[The band forms a precision drill on the field. Upon completion, the band plays a short fanfare.] The band now starts drilling as it creates “Another Opening...Another Show.”

Next week, come back with us to Providence to see the Brown University Army Band dishonorably discharge its privates.

:sd[The band marches off to “Ever True to Brown.”]
