## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you :sd[woof woof whinny oink oink meow snarl], it’s the Brown University Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand!

Ladies and gentlemen, for your halftime amusement, we present the puzzle craze that’s sweeping the country: the Brown University Rubik’s Band! Can you get the flutes, clarinets, saxes, trumpets, trombones, and percussion all on separate sides? :sd[The band has formed what resembles a cube on the field.]

Of course you can! It’s easy. Look, I’ll show you. First you turn the top face clockwise. :sd[Top face turns 1/4 turn clockwise]

Then you turn the left face counterclockwise. :sd[Left face turns 1/4 turn counterclockwise]

Then you....oh. Then you, uh, you just...uh.....then you blow a whistle! :sd[A whistle is blown, everyone runs to their correct positions]

There, wasn’t that easy? Even a monkey could have done it. Why, even a Dartmouth student ...well, maybe not. Anyway, listen now as the Band plays “Everything’s Coming Up Rubik’s”. :sd[Band plays “Everything’s Coming Up Roses”]

Alright band, enough of this frivolity. We’re going to do something serious. Let’s play Twister! :sd[Band has formed a spinner for the game “Twister” and also a jumble of people who are ready to play “Twister.”] Right hand....green! :sd[Spinner rotates 1/4 turn, players put right hands players put right hands on ground] Left foot...green! :sd[Spinner rotates 1/4 turn, players stamp left feet on ground] Left hand...green! :sd[Spinner rotates 1/4 turn, players put left hands on ground] Right foot...green! :sd[Spinner rotates 1/4 turn, players stamp right feet on ground]:sd[Snicker, snicker]. Now, left..oh, I guess that would hurt. Saluting this great American pastime, the Band plays “Twister ‘Round the Clock”. :sd[Band plays “Rock Around the Clock”]

Oh, so that was horrible, huh? Do you think you can write something better? Well, now’s your chance. We’ve reserved this part of the show for you, the audience. We want everybody out there to concentrate on what they want the band to do next, and we’ll try to pick up your thought waves and form what you want us to. Allright everybody, concentrate! :sd[Slight pause]:sd[Gasp] That’s disgusting! We can’t form _that_. And besides, freshmen, that’s not what it looks like anyway. Now come on, everybody. Concentrate on what you really want us to do. :sd[Slight pause, entire band collapses on the field] Oh now really, people. That wasn’t very nice. C’mon, everybody up! :sd[Band gets up and moves into a cross.]

Saluting the band’s miraculous recovery, the band forms a red cross on the field and plays “When the Saints Go Marching In”.

Be back in two years when you’ll have another new president. :sd[Band marches off to “Ever True”]
