## Halftime

You've heard about us in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and now Sports Illustrated. Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you freshman mothers and fathers, and their parents, we proudly present the Brown University "Bring on Time and Newsweek" Band!

Hi there, parents. So you've got a child at Brown now. Well, you've finally made it to the top, and we know you want to be the best parent you can. But do you always do the right thing? After all, raising a college-age child can be tough. Are you confused? Bewildered? Well, we have some helpful suggestions that can make you a better Brown parent. First, if a dean calls about your son, hang up immediately, and report the caller to the police. Second, remember that two N/C's a semester is considered normal. And finally, give your children lots and lots of money, and don't ask where it goes. It's all for a good cause. :sd[The band has formed a liquor bottle and a glass. In the middle of "Feelin' Groovy," the bottle pours into the glass.]

Allright, so your son has been drinking. But try to understand. Look what he has to eat. Vegetarian rice pilaf? Savory garbanzo beans? The band finds this situation intolerable. We demand that the drinking age be lowered back to 18, and the eating age at the Ratty be raised to 21. Believe us, it's for your own good. The band now salutes the trauma every freshman knows, forms your i.d. on the field, and plays "Does Anybody Really Know How Old I Am?". :sd[The band has formed an i.d. on the field. It is complete with a picture of the comic strip character Nancy, and a birthdate (6-30-62). They play "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?". On a whistle, the 2 in the birthdate changes to a 1, and then again to a 0.]

We will return to our halftime show after this commercial message.

Are you tired of pesky bands invading your stadium and telling idiotic jokes? Tired of their filthy smut and bathroom humor? Then why are you listening to this? Try new Censor-in-a-Can. Watch what happens to this filthy band after just one spray! PSSSSSSSST. :sd[Everyone in the band takes off their sweaters except for one person. Everyone is wearing white underneath.]

And look! Your whole stadium and halftime show are sparkling clean! Censor-in-aÂ­-can has earned the Moral Majority Seal of Approval. Censor-in-a-Can is also a product of the Ivory League, 99 44/100 % pure, and is available in selected Eastern States for only\
 $11,000 a year. So listen now as our new clean, All-American band plays "The Stars and Stripes Forever." :sd[The band forms the number 99 with a person holding up a sign that says "44/100." The member of the band who is still wearing their sweater holds up a sign with the number "56/100."]

Hey band, what are you going to do with that big pile of brown stuff? Oh, never mind. It's good for the grass. :sd[The band marches off to "Ever True."]
