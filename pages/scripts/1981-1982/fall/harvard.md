## Halftime

Twas halftime, and all the slide trombones, did lyre and cymbal on command. Half crazy were the saxophones, And the rest of the Brown University Band!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have something very special for you this afternoon: a show with real audience participation. So pay close attention, ‘cause we’ll need your help. :sd[The band has formed the board for the game "Concentration." 25 people are standing in the middle holding up signs with numbers on them.]

Good afternoon, everybody! It’s time to play "Concentration"! Today’s match is between the students and alumni of Brown University. Hey students, are you out there? I said hey students ARE YOU OUT THERE? Allright! Alumns, are you out there? I said alums ARE YOU OUT THERE?

Okay, we’re ready to play. Students, you have the first guess. You’ll have to shout loudly; remember, I’m way up here in the press box. Allright people, can I hear two numbers please? What? Which two? Two and nineteen? Okay. Number two? :sd[Number two walks out of formation into the outside wall.]

And number nineteen...that’s a match! :sd[Number nineteen removes himself/herself.]

Students, you’ve all just won good picks in next year’s housing lottery! Okay alums, it’s your turn. Two numbers, please. What? I can’t hear you? Eighteen and twelve? Allright, number eighteen? :sd[Number eighteen walks away.]

And number twelve...that’s a match! :sd[Number twelve walks away.]

You’ve just won a performance of the 1812 Overture by the Brown Band! :sd[Band plays "1812 Overture".]

Students, two more numbers please. Five and twenty-one? Allright. Number five? :sd[Nothing happens.]

Uhh, number five? :sd[Someone nudges number five, but nothing happens.]

_NUMBER FIVE!_:sd[A whole bunch of people grab number five, knock him/her down, and drag him/her away.]

I’m sorry ladies and gentlemen, but we seem to be having technical difficulty.

Okay, we’ve corrected the problem. And can we see number twenty-one? :sd[Tubas play a long obnoxious note.]

Oh, I’m sorry but we’ve run out of time! Can we reveal the puzzle, please? :sd[The numbers clear out, revealing a huge picture of an ice cream soda.]

That’s right, it’s the Brown University Band Homecoming Float!

And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Brown Band is proud to present something never before seen in Brown Stadium: a victory :sd[ha ha, just kidding]. Seriously, watch now as the band performs yet another impossible feat. :sd[The band marches into the word "Bruins" in script to the tune of Brown songs.]

Please rise and join us in the Brown University Alma Mater. :sd[Band plays the Alma Mater.]

Come to the Harvard game next year, and watch the Brown Band try to make it in Massachusetts. :sd[Band marches off to "Ever True"]
