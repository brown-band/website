## Halftime

The year is 1981. Yale University is a walled maximum-security prison. Getting in is easy; getting out is impossible. Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you Yalebirds, the Brown University Band presents "ESCAPE FROM NEW HAVEN"!

:sd[Band stealthily lurks out onto field.]

Entering the stadium, the coast looks clear. But all is not well, for nearby lurk hordes of unhinged criminals; vile scum outcasts of humanity, rejected by civilized society, transported to a place where they can inflict their perverse morality only on each other. But the football teams are in the locker room now, so the band is safe. Watch now as the band plays Breakout on the field and makes its escape to the tune of "Exodus."

:sd[Band plays "Exodus," and forms a simulation of the game "Breakout," with the piccolos as the paddle, and a tuba as the ball. The paddle moves and hits the ball around. Standing musicians kneel when the ball touches them. Near the end of the song, the ball breaks through and bounces around the back before coming out.]

And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the second part of our electronic halftime extravaganza, the Brown Band proudly presents an incredible breakthrough in halftime entertainment! We've given electronic switches to ten random Yale students, chosen from our halftime audience. Students, signal in your answers to the following questions, and the Band will form your scores on the field! First, students, if you would all press your buttons to make sure they're working?

:sd[The band has formed three digits that resemble a calculator display. Each member is holding a piece of red cardboard that is their "light". The entire display lights up.]

Thank you. Now, students, question 1. This summer, a new James Bond movie came out. Who played James Bond? Was it:

:::script-list

- A) Roger Moore :sd[A display lights up a '1']
- B) Dudley Moore :sd[B display lights up a '2']
- or C) Melba Moore :sd[C display lights up a '7']

:::

Hmmm. Well, perhaps you'll do better with question 2. :sd[All displays turn off.]\
 Which of the following women did Prince Charles marry?

:::script-list

- A) Diana Spencer :sd[A display lights up a '1']
- B) Diana Ross :sd[B group lights up a '3']
- or C) Rich Diana :sd[C group lights up a '6']

:::

Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Elis. The correct answer was 'A' in both questions. As a consolation prize for participating in our halftime show, you'll receive a tupperware party set and a Yale diploma. The band guesses your IQ's and plays "25 or 6 to 4."

Be back in two years for the make-up exam.

:sd[Band marches off to "Ever True."]
