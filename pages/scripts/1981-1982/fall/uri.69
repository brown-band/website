Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you Rhody-rooters, it's the Brown University "Toto, I don't think the game's in Providence anymore!" Band! <sd>Band runs out onto the field, dressed as tourists and explorers</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
In the tradition of "Raiders of the Lost Ahk", "Stah Wahs", "Lawrence of Pawtucket", and "Journey to the Center of Little Compton", the Brown University Band proudly presents "In Search of the University of Rhode Island". See the Brown Band battle traffic on I-95! See the band attempt to get wasted on a mere 20-minute bus trip! Thrill as the band tries to find overnight lodging! And marvel if the band finishes their halftime show alive! Lights, camera, action! <sd>The band forms a cue card and plays "Processional March From Star Wars"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Yes, right here in scenic Cranston, lies the site of the legendary University of Rhode Island, thought to have vanished long ago. Keep looking, band. URI has <em>got</em> to be around here somewhere. <sd>The band meanders about as if they are looking for URI.</sd>
</sp>

A great civilization must have flourished here at one time. Just look at this stadium! Imagine what it must have looked like when it was new. But now, there doesn't appear to be any sign of intelligent life....wait! Look! Over there, in the end zone! It's a group of primitive musicians in pagan costumes! And look at the natives! They've obviously discovered alcohol! Saluting this great discovery in a primitive jungle, the band forms a pith helmet on the field and plays "Swingin' Safari".

<sp>
But alas, we have failed to find the lost University of Rhode Island. Any culture that existed here must have died out long ago. Was URI reality or fantasy? That we'll never know for certain, but we all know how many universities there are in Rhode Island. <sd>The band forms the numeral '1' and plays "One"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Be back in two years when you'll see how this stadium looks when it's finished. <sd>The band marches off to "Ever True."</sd>
