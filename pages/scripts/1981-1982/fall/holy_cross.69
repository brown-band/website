<sd>Band immediately starts sneaking out onto the field, into a replica of the Bat-signal. Two people in Batman and Robin costumes are standing on the sideline, obviously talking to each other.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
"Robin, as you know, last week the evil Brown Band forced the good, peace-loving citizens of Gotham City to watch a filthy, perverted, disgusting halftime show. We think they'll strike here next, so be on the lookout for them. Under <em>no condition whatsoever</em> are they to be let into the sta..."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>By this time the band has reached the middle of the field.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
"Holy Cross, Batman! We're too late! It's them!"
</sp>
<sp>
"Ladies and gentleman, friends and alumni, and all you Caped Crusaders, in a few minutes you'll be forced to watch the most revolting halftime show you've ever seen, and not even Batman and Robin can stop it. Try to figure this one out, Dynamic Duo: this formation is a clue to our secret identity. <sd>Band forms the word 'SIN'.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
"Look, Robin. They've formed the word 'SIN'."
</sp>
<sp>
"Boy they sure did, Batman."
</sp>
<sp>
"That's right, Dynamic Dingbats! Listen now as we salute your idiotic attempts to guess our secret identity, and play 'Mission Impossible'." <sd>In the middle of "Mission Impossible," the band changes the word 'SIN' to 'COS'.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
"I don't get it, Batman."
</sp>
<sp>
"Remember your elementary calculus, Robin? Do you know about sines and cosines?"
</sp>
<sp>
"Of course! The band took its own derivative!"
</sp>
<sp>
"Yes! And what does that mean?"
</sp>
<sp>
"The   derivative   of   the   band   with   respect   to   time...d(band)/dt...d(band)/dt's...d.t.'s...ALCOHOL!"
</sp>
<sp>
"Right, Robin! And who drinks more alcohol than any other group of people?"
</sp>
<sp>
"Of course! The alumni!"
</sp>
<sp>
"No, try again."
</sp>
<sp>
"The students!"
</sp>
<sp>
"Exactly, Robin! Their secret identity has something to do with students. Look! They're about to form something disgusting!"
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The band has formed two halves of a phallic symbol which begin to march towards each other.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
If they finish that formation, thousands of innocent women and children will be offended! Quick Robin, we've got to move fast!"
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Batman and Robin singlehandedly straighten out the crooked lines on the ends, so that when the formations come together they simply form two straight lines.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
"Whew, Robin. That was close. Now let's see what they play. We already know they're students. Maybe we'll get another clue to their secret identity." <sd>The band plays "Brown Forevermore."</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
"Brown. Their secret identity has something to do with Brown and students. Brown, students. Brown, students. Brown students! Of course! The entire band goes to Providence College!"
</sp>
<sp>
"Right Robin! Next week we'll be ready for them!"
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band marches off to "Ever True".</sd>
