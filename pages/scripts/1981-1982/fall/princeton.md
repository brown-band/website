## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you incredible double rotating peons, it's the Brown University "If we can write this show in an hour, just think what we can do in a week ..." Band!

We'd like to welcome everyone here to our first home halftime show, especially the freshmen. There have been quite a few personnel changes that you should know about. For example, Bruce Donovan is now the Dean of has-been British rock singers, and Dean Mackintosh is now the Dean of Apples. Rabbi Marker is on Shabbatical this year. In addition, two new deans have been hired to make your life at Brown easier--the Dean of Chocolate Milk, Dean Ovaltine, and the Dean of Punk Rock, Debbie Harriet Sheridan. Gee, with all these deans, this place is getting to be a regular "Deantown." :sd[The band forms a replica of University Hall and plays "Downtown."]

All kidding aside, though, we'd like to talk about something serious. We'd like to talk about a group of people who, last year, performed acts that shamed the name of this great university. These people lived in prime on-campus housing, and enjoyed special privileges that they flagrantly abused. Yes, we're talking about the administrators in University Hall. Did you know that these hard core rowdies were responsible for 25% of all cost overruns, 50% of all admissions complaints, and 89% of all legal damages, more than all other departments combined?

The band gives our administration the Delta Tau treatment, forms the doors to University Hall, and plays "Closed To You."

Perhaps some of you out there have noticed that this show is just a little bit, uh, different. Well, according to an article in the New York Times last summer, we're going to have to clean up our act. Our shows will be censored even more. But don't you worry. Increased censorship will have _no effect whatsoever_ on our halftime presentations. So watch now as the band forms an enormous :sd[bleep] on the field and :sd[bleep bleep blippity dih dah dit etc] as it plays "C'mon Baby Light My Fire." :sd[The band forms a square which changes into a rectangle during the rendition of "Light My Fire."]

Be back in two weeks to see the Brown Band :sd[bleep]. :sd[The band marches off to "Ever True"]
