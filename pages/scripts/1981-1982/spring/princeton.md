Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you paper tigers, Hurry, Hurry, Hurry, step right up, it’s the Brown University Circus-ized Band.

:sd[Band Skates out on the ice into 3 rings]\
:sd[Band plays’ Thunder and Blazes’]

Yes folks, it’s that all-time favorite, the circus with a new cast of stars. See the Fearless Ratty Worker do her job without a hairnet! See the clowns from University Hall! And now, brought in from Third Floor West at very little expense, we bring you three of the most fantastic acts this side of the Seekonk River. In ring one, we have the Juggling Gigilo. Please be quiet as this trick requires deepest concentration.

:sd[In first ring, which is rotating, we have a juggler juggling something absurd like a grapefruit, a football and an M+M, After he finishes, the band plays a double-note.]

Later in the show, we’ll see if he can juggle the UCS budget. We now bring your attention to ring 2, where our weightlifter is performing. Wait, Lift her. Wait, Lift her.

:sd[As each instruction is given, the weightlifter either waits or lifts a girl who is in his arms.] No matter how strong he is, though, he can’t lift the UCS out of the hole. And finally, in ring three, we present, the Great Zambonis.

:sd[There are three people who do absolutely nothing impressive.]

Watch now, as the band salutes the biggest circus of all, and plays ‘Big Spender’

:sd[Band forms the letters UCS on the ice]

Be back in two weeks for another UCS election.
