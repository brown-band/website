Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, may I have your attention please? We are proud to have with us tonight a very special band. No, not a band, but a group of godlike terpsichoreans, whose grace and skill on their instruments and on the ice will make you forget all about the petty concerns of your dull, retched lives, and whose very presence here tonight will cause the site of this hockey rink to be revered by all mankind, from generation to generation, long after our own primitive civilizations have crumbled to dust. Ladies and gentlemen, would you please lie down and grovel, and welcome the world's only and best -- The Brown University Skating Band, and the June Taylor Skaters!

:sd[Band plays Stars and Stripes Forever]

Be back in two periods for some real hockey.
