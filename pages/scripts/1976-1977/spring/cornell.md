Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at sea. Direct from an appearance as a skating Peanut in the Inaugural Parade, featuring the world’s only skating string bass, it’s the worst disaster since the winter of ’77, The Brown University Skating Band.

:sd[Band forms 10 horizontal rows.]

Watch now as the flaky band drifts onto the ice, flurries into a snow storm and plays ”Another Opening, Another Snow, Another Closing.”

:sd[During dialogue, band skates into snowflakes. In formation play the song, while flakes spin in opposite directions.]

Barging into an even cruder ecological disaster—no, not the Cornell band—we salute the navigation prowess of the Liberian oil tankers, those perenially pestiferous purveyors pumping potentially perilous petroleum who live by the old adage, “Don’t cry over spilled oil.” Finally, the band takes a spill, forms their missing ship’s helm and plays “Oil Can Can.”

:sd[During dialogue skate into formation, play “Can Can” with outside wheel and spokes moving clockwise, inside wheel skating backwards counterclockwise, and people in center down on the ice performing choreography a la June Taylor dancers.]

Tune in in two weeks when the band performs Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony in the original German.

:sd[During dialogue, skate into large circle, play “BBB” and skate into B, skate off ice to “Ever True To Brown.”]
