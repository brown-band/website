The Brown University Marching Band.

:sd[The band runs into a spiral.]

Once upon a time, a young girl form Kansas, named Dorothy, decided to go to an Ivy League school in New York but couldn’t find one. Suddenly the weather changed, and a tall gyrating mass rose up, engulfing Dorothy, and thrust her to the land of Columbia instead. The band forms this torrential twister and plays “Thunder and Blazes.”

Dorothy, in her quest to transfer out, comes upon a fork in the road and stops to munchkin her lunch. Fed up, Dorothy and her dog Toto, a Yale Alum, encountered a scarecrow from Cornell, who naturally had no brains. And if that wasn’t the last straw, soon she came upon a rusted stiff from Princeton, and one of the many cowardly lions of Columbia. The band follows the yellow brick road to the intersection of 42nd and Broadway and plays “Walk on the Wild Side.”

:sd[The band forms a 4-way intersection.]

Reaching the Empire City, our intrepid band of travelers, takes on the wicked witch of the west side of New York, Jackie Mattfeld. After an enlightening experience for the scarecrow, the witch gets washed up. The band pulls a hat trick and plays “Raindrops Keep Falling on My Witch.”

:sd[The Band forms a pointed hat and plays “Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.”]

Returning to the wizard, Dorothy finds that despite his many degrees, he’s a phony from, you guessed it, Harvard. But the good witch of the East Side of Providence comes to the rescue. The band clicks its heels together and says three times, “There’s no place like Brown!” We pay tribute to Columbia and play the heels of Ivy.

:sd[The Band forms two shoes and plays “The Halls of Ivy.”]

Be back in two years when the band salutes the famous Civil War battle Aunti-em.
