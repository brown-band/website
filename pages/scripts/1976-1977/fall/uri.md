Enough of this flocking around. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you intermingling _Ram_-parts. As everyone knows, true revolutionaries don’t wear spiffy tri-colored uniforms from Sears, Roebuck & Co. Instead they wear ragged clothes, fight with whatever arms they can find, and attack from behind the bushes. :sd[Band runs out from behind bushes.] Ladies and Gentlemen, the Brown University Bearfoot Band. :sd[Come out barefoot, in ragged clothes with slings, crutches, bandages, etc.]

The band rises to the occasion and plays “Yankee Doodle.”

Turning from Yankee Doodles to Napoleans, the band lays its glaze on the anals of the French Revolution. We recall the famous tool used on Marie Antoinette, the guillotine. Now we’ve stuck our neck out before, but this time the band’s finally lost its head. We take the Bone-apart, form a guillotine and play “Mack The Knife.”

Getting its head together, the band turns its attention to the undercover activities of that famous Civil War spy, Jack Union. He must Grope through the bush, penetrate the lower regions of the moist Mississippi Delta, and aim his cannon at his objective. Watch now as the cannon shoots off as the Band plays an arousing version of “Up, Up, Up, And Away.”

Be back in two weeks when once again the band is revolting.
