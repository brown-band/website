Ladies and Gentleman, Friends and Alumni, and all you—:sd[change voice] Now wait a minute; I’m fed up with these band shenanigans, and all this beating around the bush. Come out from behind there and for once act like a real band.

:sd[Band runs out from bushes silently and blocks up at the 20.]

All right, that’s better; Ladies and gentleman, the Brown University Marching, that’s right, MARCHING Band.

:sd[March out to Everything’s coming up Roses, counter marches at far 30. People begin to fall down, two ranks miss counter march; at end of song, odd numbered ranks stop, even ranks keep marching and crash into odd ranks—general confusion.]

Live and half crocked, from Providence, Rhode Island, it’s Saturday Afternoon! Starring John Christie, and the Not Ready for Halftime Players. We’ll be right back after this word from our sponsor.

Hi! I’m Sally Struthers. Until recently, I had a voice that would summon dogs, shatter glass, and kill chickens. Then Frank Purdue enrolled me in :sd[chord] The Brown Band School of Announcing, not affiliated with the Brown Band or any other non-muscical organization. Now I can say such things as “the drains in White Plains are backed up from the rains” without breaking into an uncontrollable slumber. So if you’d like this once in-a-lifetime opportunity to increase your ability, influence friends, and make people, send $50 and a case of any imported liquor to the Brown Band, Box 1145, Hanover, New Hampshire, and maybe you too can introduce songs like this.

:sd[Band forms radio and plays “Classical Gas.”]

And now weekend update. :sd[toke] We’re the Brown Band, and you’re not. In our top story of the day, President Ford has challenged Jimmy Carter to a post-election debate, to be sponsored by the International League of Ladies Garment Workers Union. Topics are scheduled to include redecoration of the White House, naming the peanut the national bird, and veto power, the president’s Italian pilot. Betty Ford commented that she doesn’t see any reason why, just because Jerry lost, she should have to move out of the White House. A Gallup Poll released today stated that 17% of those people who voted for Gerald Ford fell down while pulling the lever. Furthermore, 95% of Jimmy Carter’s supporters admitted to often having lustful thoughts. The remaining 5% of those surveyed admitted to being dead. The news will continue after the Band votes and plays “Gospel Jimmy.”

:sd[Band forms a voting booth and plays “Gospel John.” Lever of loser comes down and breaks off. Song stops in the middle.]

Hey, fix that election.

:sd[Arm moves back, and lever of winner moves down.]

And now a weekend update exclusive. Our in-depth reporting has dug up the fact that Brown University’s new president Howard Swearer will, upon taking office, follow in the footsteps of some great American leaders. That’s right, his first official act will be to pardon former President Donald F. Hornig. On the lighter side, doctors for Spain’s Generalissimo Fransisco Franco report today that his condition is stable, and that he’s keeping a stiff upper lip. In Washington, chief Justice Warren Burger ruled that it is unconstitutional to censor halftime shows because, he stated, college bands should have the right to \<bleep\> on the field. And finally the environmental protection agency announced that, although daytime automobile smog is still rampant, nocturnal emissions are completely under control. The band forms a police car pursuing a speeding GM auto, thus a Chevy Chase, and plays “Tailgate Ramble.”

And now for an editorial reply.

:sd[Voice of Emily Latella, ie., Laurel Greenburg]

What’s all this fuss about a swearer coming to Brown. You’d think with that band down there, a little foul language wouldn’t make any difference. And besides:sd[interupted by normal voice] No, no that’s Brown’s new president Howard Swearer. :sd[Emily]: Well that’s different. Never mind. The band welcomes our new president in the tradition of the major Midwest marching musicians and does the impossible on the field.

:sd[Band forms “Brown” in script]

And now please rise, and join the band as we play the Brown University Alma Mater. Be back in hockey season when the band asks the musical question: What’s an ice band like you, doing in a rinky-dink place like this?
