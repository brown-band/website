Ladies and Gentleman, Friends and Alumni, and all you panama red. Presenting the only band to be thrown out at home for reaching third base, direct from a seventh inning stretch, it’s the Brown University Rubber Band.

Passing over football, the band decides to take a run at America’s second favorite pastime, baseball. We lead off with a look at the innings and outings of pitching where the all important question is: Can the pitcher sneak his fastballs past the batter’s box? Of course all smart hurlers must remember to plant firmly on the mound and never forget the pitching rubber. Winding up, the band forms a pitcher and plays “Beer Barrel Polka.”

The band takes a short stop.

Turning from hard balls to fuzzy balls, the band queries\
“Tennis anyone?” Unable to find an opponent, we perform a public service, but we fall down, thus losing a point on the asphalt. Still finding no match, we decide to play with ourselves. So the band, known for our base-lines, makes a racquet and plays “Wild World of Courts.”

Taking the cow by the horns, the band salutes Cornell’s favorite pastime, bullfighting. Big Red alums claim one matador could slay an entire pack of these beasts, but we all know that’s a lot of bull. Gored to death, the band forms what’s left, the bull’s eye, and plays “Entry to the Arena.”

:sd[Plays “Entry to the Coliseum.”]

Be back in two years to see if the band can cope with another horny dilemma.
