Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you freshman mothers and fathers, and their parents. We’ve locked our next contestant, the Brown Band, into a sound-proof booth so they can’t hear what I’m about to say. You see, the Band’s twin sister, whom they haven’t seen for the past 5 years is in our stadium today. When we bring them out in the middle of the first formation, we ask you not to let them in on our secret. :sd[Pause.] All right Johnny, who’s our nest contextant? Brown Band, Come on down!

:sd[male half of band comes out from home stands]

Today’s show is brought to you by General Mills, the makers of Wheaties, the breakfast of Brown men.

Okay band, how would you like to win this fabulous prize—tell ’em about it Johnny.

:sd[Announcer’s voice]: That’s right Bob. It’s a beautiful Holy Cross pen, and it’s initialed by God himself.

:sd[MC’s voice]: And all you have to do is to tell us which of the following items is nearest in value to the Brown student government. Is it

:::script-list

- A) a year’s supply of eskimo pies,
- B) The card-forter debates
- C) An all expense paid weekend for two in beautiful Worcester, Mass. OR
- D) A 25 cent gift certificate from the Spiegel Catalog, Chicago, Illinois, 60609

The band forms its manufacture’s suggested retail price and plays the best things in life are free.

:sd[Band forms a circle. During the song, a loud whisper.]

Alright Johnny, bring on the Pembroke band.

:sd[Female half of band comes out from away stands.]

Now that our couples have been reunited and the match game is over, the Band loses its concentration and salutes the world’s oldest professional game show. It goes something like this: I’ve got a secret. You don’t say. $20,000 pyramid, treasure hunt, almost anything goes, the price is right, let’s make a deal, uh oh jeopardy :sd[few bars of Dragnet]. The band hits the jackpot forms a slot machine and plays “Big Spender.”

And now it’s time for the Band’s big deal of the day. Brown Alumni, here’s your chance to trade away your life savings for a chance to build Brown’s endowment, what door do you choose? :sd[People in door 1 jump up and down.] Okay it’s door number one. Now for the student body, what door do you choose? :sd[Door 3 jumps up and down] Okay it’s 3 for you. Let’s look behind door number one. For the alumni it’s free acceptances to Brown for all your children and a dinner at the Ratty will be named in your honor. And for the student body, behind door number three, what’s this? It’s an elevator. Once again the students get the shaft. The Band gets gonged and plays the “Great Gates of Monte Hall.”

:sd[Play “Great Gates of Kiev”]

No one leaves our show empty-handed, so as a consolation prize, stop by after the show and we’ll give you Carol Merril’s box.
