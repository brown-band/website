:sd[Due to excessive rain, the Band was not allowed to perform on the field, so the planned show was scrapped and a off-the-cuff show, written in the stands during the first quarter by Rich Carson and gang, was performed.]

## Planned Show

Enough of this Penn-demonium. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you retractable pens. Presenting the high wires of the marching circuits, with a frequency to handle any resistance. Breaker 19, it’s the Brown University Citizen’s Band.

:sd[Run out from stands to blob at base of 50 yard line]

On the request of many Alumni, today the band will discuss something it knows very little about, music. Conducting ourselves in ac-chord with FCC measures, the Band refrains from violin-ce and sax. So turning Bach from our Haydn Place and still trebling, the Band forms a G clef and plays “Does Anybody Really Know What Key It Is?”

Cleft to our own devices, the Band takes a rest at that orchestra pit, stop, Horn and Hardart. We sharpen our taste buds with such treats as Drum Rolls, Harmony Grits, Pizza-Cato, Petit Fortes, and Orange Schubert. Watch now as the band forms a bowl full of Cello and Plays “Cello Dolly.”

Hello. I’m Richard Nixon. Do you remember me singing that smash hit “Pardon Me Boys?” They don’t write songs like that anymore. Well, maybe they shouldn’t. Right now you can get such fabulous hits as Nelson Rockefeller singing “C’mon Get Happy,” “The First Noel” by Richard Lorber, “The Magnificent Seven” by Snow White, “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” by Mary Hartman Mary Hartman, and Elizabeth Ray Singing “10,000 Men of Harvard.” Turning the tables, the Band forms a phonograph and plays “Feeling Groovy.”

:sd[Arm of record player moves over during song and at one point repeats.]

Be back in two years when the band lets the pigs out of the Penn.

## Actual Show (as performed by the Brown Band)

::script-note[Band remained on the track during entire show.]

Enough of this Penndemonium. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you retractable pens. Direct from a one mile swim from campus, the only band without enough sense to come in from the rain, presenting the Brown University 10,000 Man Invisible band. Watch now as the band performs a spritely drill formation to the tune of “Ever True to Brown.”

Being a colorful group, the band takes up oil painting. Watch now as we create one of the great masterpieces of all time. Notice the delicate hues and subtle shading. Yes, that’s right, it’s the Mona Lisa, and the band plays “Make Me Smile.”

Moving right along, the band forms three of the major landmarks of Europe. Here we see the Eiffel Tower…Now the Band forms the Roman Coliseum—Notice the track meet going on in the center. Finally, the Band forms Big Ben and plays “Rock Around the Clock.”

Finally in this Bicentennial Year, the Band moves to—no, not Philadelphia—but Washington D.C. Watch now as the Band forms the White House, complete with spiraled columns and the lawn fountain, which has apparently gotten out of hand. Look! There’s President Ford…and Betty, and they’re waving!! What about it, fans, wave back!! The Band salutes the First Family and plays the “White Horse.”

Stay tuned for between periods when the band will demonstrate how to plant rice on the field.
