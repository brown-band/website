Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Crimson stains. Presenting the high wires of the Marching circuits, with a frequency to handle any resistance. Breaker 1-9, it’s the Brown University Citizen’s Band.

:sd[Run out into two parallel lines at the 50 yard-line.]

On the request of many alumni, today the Band will salute something it knows very little about, music. Conducting ourselves in A-chord with FCC measures, the Band refrains from violin-ce and sax. Returning Bach from our Haydn place, and still trebling, the Band forms a G clef and plays, “Does Anybody Really Know What Key It Is?”

:sd[Two lines change into a G clef and the Band plays “Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?”]

Cleft to our own devices, the Band takes a rest at that orchestra pit stop, Horn and Hardart. We sharpen our taste buds with such treats as Drum Rolls, Harmony Grits, Pizza-Cato, Petit Fortes, Orange Schubert, and there’s always room for Cello. The Band forms this vibrating voluminous violin and plays “Cello Dolly.”

Hello. I’m Richard Nixon. Do you remember me singing that smash hit, “Pardon Me Boys?” They don’t write songs like that anymore. Well, maybe they shouldn’t. Right now you can get such fabulous hits as Nelson Rockefeller singing “C’mon Get Happy,” “Bridge Over Troubled Waters” by Teddy Kennedy, “The Magnificent Seven” by Snow White, “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” by Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, and Elizabeth Ray singing “10,000 Men of Harvard.” Turning the tables, the Band forms a phonograph and plays “Feeling Groovy.”

:sd[Band forms a record player. The arm moves toward center of turntable during the song. At one point arm jumps and a portion of the song repeats.]

Stay tuned for the further misadventures of the Derek Bok Chorale.
