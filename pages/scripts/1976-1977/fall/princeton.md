Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Frosted Flakes. We all know that Princeton is lacking in the biology department, both educationally and physically. So the Brown Band has taken it upon itself to fill the void with every last juicy drop of information. So for all you bleeding hearts, presenting the Brown University Lonely Hearts Club Band.

:sd[Band comes out to heart beat sounds from drums.]

Lymphing onto the field, the band takes a vein look at that Transylvanian treat, that Dracula drools over, the bleh, bleh, blood :sd[Dracula voice]. We recall the discovery of elite blood types by Smith-Corona including

The band forms a blood-vessel and plays “Anchors Aweigh.”

Turning from veins to brains, the band strikes a spinal cord :sd[a chord] and reflex upon the ne-ne-e-nervous system. Driven to a highly neurotic state, New Jersey, the band has a nervous breakdown, stops at an axon station, and dendrites a check. Impulsively, the band forms a Princeton man’s EEG and plays “I’ve Got Plenty Of Nothing.”

Making no bones about it, the band knuckles down to the subject of bones and joints. With a cast of thousands we pay a tribute to some famous graduates of the Princeton Chiropractic School of Medicine including Mia Marrow, Red Skeleton, Pelvis Presley, Shin Connery, Sonny Bono, Ossify and Harriet, and Jerry Mathers as the Beaver. Covering all the ankles, the band gets hip, forms a knee jerk and plays “Knuckle Down, Winsocki.”

Be back in two years to see if the Brown Band is still in circulation.
