Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you sons of fem:script-tab[]ale mascots. Presenting the only group that flunked out freshman week; direct from a quick engagement in the Faunce House Rest Room; it’s the Brown University Freshman Week Disorientation Band.

:sd[Run out into cocktail glass]

Now that you’ve picked yours, the band would like to suggest a fe:script-tab[]w courses that even Charley Tillinghast could pass, with _flying_ colors. There’s:

:::script-list

- A) Bio 103 The Stomach and Intestinal Area—one of our real guts.
- B) History 53 Lincoln: The Man and The Car.
- C) Applied Math 219 Computer Dating with Your Calculator and
- D) Special Themes and Topics 7: The Ratty, World Hunger, and You.

And now, a hot flash from Milton Noble in the Registrar’s Office: Chem 1A, BSA Bartending, has been rescheduled to the GCB Hour. The Band applauds this instructive itinerary of inviting inebriants and plays “Make Me Smile.”

Return with us now to those days of yesteryear, to the daring adventures of those stalwarts of justice, those defenders of student rights… :sd[finish theme]… The Student Caucus. :sd[continue and fade out]. Last week we left our heroes in mortal combat for calendar reform. Will they be able to prevent the prestidigitation of the pretentious purloiners of pupils’ privileges? Can they avoid snatching defeat from the jaws of victory? Frankly, no. The band salutes there remains of the student carcass and plays the Brown Student Government March.

:sd[Plays “Mickey Mouse March”]

And what show about Brown would be complete without a Bicentennial Minute? Hello. My name is Merton Stolz. Two hundred years ago today, I was interim President of Brown University. And that’s the way it was. The band Forms a Bicentennial Minute on the field and plays “Rock Around the Clock.”

Be back next week when the band asks the musical question; What’s the difference between a Harvard John and a Yale Bowl?

:sd[March off to “Ever True.”]
