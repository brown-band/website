Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you poor slobs who can't hear us 'cause of the lousy acoustics, it's the Brown University "ice? what ice??" Band!!!

Well, while you're all standing there watching us make fools of ourselves on the ice, the United States Olympic hockey team is attempting to gird up their dirndls and mince their struedel with the Austrian hockey team. But you made the right choice in staying to watch us. After all, who wants to see Bob Beattie's receding hairline and Jim MacKay's dentures when you can take bets on which bandmember is going to rack themselves up? :sd[5 to 1 on the sousaphone] In our support of the media blitz on ABC, with 50 camera crews, 6 satellite remotes, and 300 cases of Molson, we now form a bottle of beer on the ice, think fondly of Kathleen Sullivan's sweater, and play "Wide World of Sports."

:sd[Band plays WWoS and forms a bottle.]

On the home front, Residential Services has once again reared its ugly head, causing a flurry of activity in that bastion of journalism, the Brown Daily Herald. It seems that several students had items stolen out of their rooms over vacation. When questioned about the event, the Residential Services office was unable to comment due to the new CD player being turned up too loud. The band now forms one of the missing keys on the ice and plays "Richard Spahr Wars."

:sd[Band forms a key and plays "Processional from Star Wars."]

The band now does what we refer to as a counter skate, what you refer to as an unholy mess.

Be back in 2 weeks when we play Princeton and lick the pussies.
