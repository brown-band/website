Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, it's the Brown University "we may suck at ice skating, but we're the reigning world champions in the two-man spluge" Band!
</sp>
<sp>
The band would first like to salute ABC for its "better than latex" coverage of the Fifteenth Winter Olympic Games. They really rose to the occasion with their probing camerawork, their in-depth interviews, and their pointed commentary. And speaking of commentators, what about that ABC line-up! At the head, Jim McKay, denture-wearer, is still giving us his all. And, as always, good ol' Keith Jackson comes in behind Jim, surprising him--and us too--with his oh-so-perfect imitation of the body of Orson Welles possessed by the spirit of Jonathan Winters. Yes, and who could forget Lynn Swann waxing himself philosophically with insights like "in the bobsled competition, you need consistency, consistency, consistency . . . and survival"? <sd>Read like a period, however.</sd> In fact, only Dick Button didn't live up to his name. He just got a little too excited when the male figure skaters did those back double-twists. That's okay though, Dick. Psychological damage is only to be expected in those who spent a year at Harvard.

Watch now on the ice as the band forms the Olympic symbol with three undescended rings and plays Peggy Fleming's "Wide World of Spurts, Gurgles, and Swallows."

Watch now as the band does its own version of the biathlon by playing music while skating both ways.
