Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Ands, Buts and Bobby Orrs, it's the Brown University "Hell no, we won't go!" Band!
</sp>

Some words that make our censor nervous: Moist, Lick, Tongue, Loin, Smell, Bulge, Vein. A few formations that cause our censor to sweat include a zoom lens; an MX missile going through the goalposts; the building of the Washington monument; and Brown's ever-growing endowment. We present these as our New Year's resolution. We're through offending people with subtle perversions and <i>hinted</i> obscenities. We're turning over a new fig leaf...er leaf. We're tired of being rude. The band now forms a pair of crotchless panties on the ice and plays "Dude Looks like a Lady." Just kidding. We salute the new semester by asking the trustees to find a president that will give his or her all For Bruno and For Brown.

1988 should be a great year. The Olympics will see the world's finest athletes competing for the gold, and the election will see the country's finest politicians competing for the media's attention. But rather than prick their balloons and make fun of their short comings, we merely give a cheer for the United States Olympic team. Watch now as we give our rendition of the Trinidad and Tobago hockey team, form a hockey puck, and play "Championship."

Be back next week when we play Clarkson, a school that's really going places. And we wish they'd get started.
