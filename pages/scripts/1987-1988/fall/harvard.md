## Halftime

Ladies and Germs, Friends and Alum, and all you freshman mothers and fathers, and their parents, it's the Brown University, "you thought our jokes were bad before" Band!!

:sd[Band runs out.]

Here's an act with a lot of polish...and they're gonna sell it right after the show. The Band truly is a group of performers in their own class. NO CLASS! Hah, hah, yuk, yuk. No, really, folks, we just flew in from Vegas last night. Boy, are our arms tired. Seriously, though, we'd like to ask you a question: Is your refrigerator running? Well, you better catch it then. Hah, hah, yuk, yuk. Did you take a shower this morning? Well, you better put it back! Seriously, you know, when we were growing up, we were so poor that at dinnertime the cockroaches went next door! No, seriously folks, I kid cockroaches, but I love 'em. The band now forms a tin container on the field and asks do you have Prince Albert in a can-can?

:sd[Band forms a can and plays "Can-Can."]

:sd[Band stands there for a moment, unsure of what to do.]

But wait! Something's missing. Where are the seniors? Ya can't do a Parents' Weekend Show without the seniors!! Come on, guys, where are you?

:sd[A regular limo pulls out from the parking lot and begins to drive around the track. After a suitable amount of laughter from the audience:]

I think this is a good time to make an analogy. It's true that Harvard has some class. They're clean and slick, and have all the right moves. But when you come right down to it, Brown is just that much better.

:sd[A super long limo pulls out to follow the other one]

And you thought Harvard was well-endowed!! You know, our seniors have been looking at career opportunities for life after Brown. We thought of the plumbing business, but it's all backed up!! Hah, hah, yuk, yuk. Or maybe the elevator business, but that has its ups and downs. Or we could become lens grinders and make spectacles of ourselves. Hah, hah, yuk, yuk. Seriously, though, if we knock the wind out of Harvard's sails today, we're the best in the Ivy League, not that we had to prove it or anything. The band now forms Harvard's bruised ego on the field and plays "Ivy League Championship."

:sd[Band forms something like an ego and plays "Championship."]

The band is saddened to learn of the departure of so many high ranking officials of Brown. Their presence will be missed. Take Howard Swearer. Please. Take Howard Swearer. Hoping it doesn't cloud the issue, the band now forms Jack Benny's violin bow and plays "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes."

:sd[Band forms a bow and plays "S.G.I.Y.E."]

The Band would like to express its gratitude to Rosemary's Limousine Service of South Attleboro and College Hill Travel right on Thayer Street for their assistance with this show. And thanks to the Athletic Department for not spazzing over their new track. Be back in 3 weeks when the Columbia Football Film Society shows _The Big Easy_. Say Goodnight Band. "Goodnight, Band."

:sd[Band marches off to "Ever True." Hah, hah, yuk, yuk.]

Notes: This Parents' Weekend exercise in spectacle featured a loss on the team's part, thus dashing our hopes for the league championship. (Buttheads.) But we did have a good time playing with all the gizmos in the limousines.
