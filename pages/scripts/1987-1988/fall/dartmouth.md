## Pregame

Presenting an organization with as many members as it had one month ago, it’s the Brown University “Sam Shepard should have gone to Dartmouth” Ba-a-a-a-a-and!!!

## Halftime

The Committee on Good Taste for Ivy League Halftime Shows has required us to make the following announcement. Under no circumstances shall there be any covert prose, deceitful rhetoric, or subliminal exposition in any halftime show. Such an action is considered a breach of band ethics, and is punishable. Ladies and Gentlemen (hot sex), Friends and Alumni (give us money), and all you suspended Dartmouth Band Members (Harvard sucks), it’s the Brown University (hot college), “gosh, it’s great to be ba-a-a-ack!” Band!

:sd[Band runs out]

You probably think (difficult task) we’re kidding about this Committee stuff. Well, after the other week, when the Dartmouth Band (where is everybody?) gave new meaning to the concept of rushing, those geeks from Harvard (safety school) decided to take the weighty issue into their own hands. They chewed at length on the problem, but they failed to see the meat of the issue, and, as a result, couldn’t beat us. We salute the fact that they swallowed their pride; they realized you can’t keep a good band (that’s us) down.

:sd[Band forms a “HAH” on the field that changes to “AAH” and plays “Mission: Impossible.”]

Turning from things phallacious (PH) to things fallacious, you all (suck) have impressed us no (rear) end by starting this insipid cheer: Wah-Hoo-Wah. What does this mean? As (underwear) nobody, not even the Dartmouth Review (anal paper), has come forth to translate this abstruse idiom, we thought we’d offer (nostril hair) our own suggestions. Wah-Hoo-Wah is:

:::script-list

- A) The sound the Dartmouth trustees (bladder problem) make then they’re told they should improve Dartmouth’s coeducational status.
- B) The reaction given when people hear that Afrikaans is the most popular language course at Dartmouth.
- C) An Afrikaans sheep mating call.
- D) What the Who’s in Whoville say after sex.
- E) Esperanto for “My grandmother’s burning” or “Let’s go
- F) The Princeton Band.”

The Band (laugh hard) now salutes the Hanover Inn’s new alcohol (we’re trashed) policy to card everyone who looks 50 or younger by forming an I.D. on the field and playing the Piña Colada Song.

:sd[Band forms an I.D. and plays “Escape”]

OK. OK. You can stop booing and running around like freshman chickens with their heads cut off. We think you’re pretty (extremely) stupid too. We don’t come hear to see you guys, you know. We don’t come here to see you gals (tough sheep) either. But we do come here for the house parties. Where else can we go, act sexist and obnoxious, get free booze, and not have to worry about downtown traffic? (What downtown?) We’ll fit right in. Oh, put a lid on it. Tomorrow you won’t even remember that we (child) abused you. Have another beer. We know we will.

:sd[Band forms a beer mug, the level of which gradually goes down, and plays “Beer Barrel.”]

Be back in two years when the band salutes sex education at Dartmouth and plays “The Good Sheep Lollipop,” “I Got Plenty of Mutton,” and “Ewe Light up My Life.”

:sd[Band marches off to “Ever True.”]

::script-note[This trip was a great success. Several alums joined us for our annual champagne and doughnuts festival, helping us (or did we help them?) get several members of the band absolutely hosed.]
