## Halftime

:sd[Voice of "Cornell" Band] Presenting a band that needs to ketchup on its 36 credits though it relishes every one with mustard, it's the Cornell University Precision Drum and Bugle Precision Facist Band:

:sd[The "Cornell" Band marches out from the sideline in formation, looking very stupid. Their drums play a boring cadence. And Joanne has real, flaming batons.]

We're the award-winning band with those nationally renowned flaming batons--ooo, look at those flamers, we're so glad to be here in Providence, Rhode Island. But wait...that's where Brown is, isn't it? Gee, maybe we're not so glad. Hey, where's Amy Carter, gang? Paying tribute to that Ivy school of New England, the C.U.P.D.B.P.F.B. now asks what's the color of Brown...no, wait...

:sd[Band has formed a row of columns by now in front of the Brown stands, and immediately launches into the high school cheer. The Brown Band, having made itself obvious in the endzone, yells back, "High School Cheer!"]

You guys thought you were so tough 2 years ago by kicking us off the field. Well, you know what? We don't care what you think of us. We don't care if we're geeks and aggies and cow tippers. We turn our backs on you.

:sd[Band turns and marches away from Brown Band. Voice of Band comes on.]

Get out of here, you simp. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you déjà vu Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you déjà vu crowd-pleasing Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Viet Nam Veterinarians, it's the Brown University "get out of the way, you buttheads!" Band!

:sd[Brown Band runs out and mows down C'nell Band, leaving two rather injured folks on the field to crawl around and do the same things we did two years ago.]

Well, well, well. So, once again Cornell's turnout is sparse, to put it mildly. That's too bad. We had such a good show planned—complete with 2 hours worth of fireworks, 300 Egyptian dancers, 08 leftover chariots from _Ben Hur_, 2000 tons of TNT in strategic places, a 250-foot tall, helium-filled float of Howard Swearer in his boxer shorts, and free Busch beer for the entire crowd. Oh well. Their loss. The Brown Band, however, just last week won several awards, including second prize in the Newark Airport Band Festival, held last year on the George Washington Bridge; first prize in the Mrs. Bauman Memorial Band Competition, held last month in confusion; and best of show at the Jessica Hahn Bimbo Buffing Band Invitational held last week in leotards. The band now forms a trophy on the field and salutes its ego by playing "Championship."

:sd[Band forms trophy and plays "Championship."]

Instead of some Buzby Berkley production sequence, we've put away the 3000 ostrich feathers and 20 fountains and decided to do a brief dissertation on the differences between those two fine institution of the Ivy League, Brown and Cornell. First of all, let's examine their curricula.

Brown's semiotic orientation provides a metaphysical framework in which to unpack Brunonian academics. But in so doing, we must reiterate that other ellipsis of the metaphysics or onto-theology of the logos (par excellence in its Hegelian moment) as the powerless and oneiric effort to master absence by reducing the metaphor within the absolute parousia of sense. Of course, such a logocentric disavowal will...oh, wait. Are we confusing you? We're sorry. The band apologizes and speaks in a language all you little lambs of Ezra Cornell can understand.

:sd[Band begins mooing and making various animal noises.]

The band now questions the curious disparity between human midwifery and animal husbandry and salutes Cornell's curriculum.

:sd[Band forms the back end of a horse and plays "Mr. Ed."]

In other developments, it seems that the Brown Daily Herald, that bastion of accurate collegiate journalism, is sponsoring a contest to find THE picture of Brown University. They want to capture on film the essence of Brunonia; discover the hidden excitement embedded in the daily life of a great University. Well, unbeknownst to many of you, the Band sponsored its own competition to find a photography that shows the antithesis of Brown. Our finalist photos included:

In the spirit of preserving the moment, the band now forms its award-winning 69-300 mm zoom lens on the field and plays "Brown Forevermore."

:sd[What it says. The lens, of course, grows longer during the song.]

Be back in two weeks when we confirm for all of you parents all those nagging suspicions and haunting doubts. :sd[Evil laugh]

:sd[Band marches off to "Ever True."]

Notes: This show, of course, reprised our triumph of two year precious where we masqueraded as the Cornell Band, many Brunonians believing us to be the real thing. Shiela Clifford '88 returned in her triumphant role as the Voice of the Cornell Band. And a humorous torch was added when the flaming torches (towels soaked in kerosene) flew gracefully off their batons onto the field, leaving some nice burn marks in the sod.
