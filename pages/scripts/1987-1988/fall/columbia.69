Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you low grade Columbians, it's the Brown University "Yes, they lowered the admissions standards so Brown could have a" Band! 
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>whistle</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>band runs out onto field</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Well, it's that time of year now, when Brown seniors trade their tie-dyes for neckties, their backpacks for briefcases, and their souls for an interview with Rubbermaid, Inc., (testing division, of course). Yes, it's open season on job hunting. But it's not never too late to make up for all those slip-ups in the past when you tried to come from behind, but couldn't. So what if you took all your classes Slide/No Cookies, so what if you ignored your Concentration advisor and listen to your Lizer adviser instead, so what if you are doing an independent concentration on the role of the Brady Bunch in American society? There's still an organization that will hire you, even if you did smoke pot once in the Seventies and a couple or fifty times in the Eighties. Thrust your hedonistic impulses into an organization that really appreciates some good immorality, the CIA. Travel, see the world, participate in overt, covert operations. And remember, it's not just a job, it's an indenture. In the spirit of the New Freedom fighters everywhere, watch now as the band forms an "ooo-uzi" on the field and discharges the seniors for their premature entry into the real world.

<halftime>
<sp>
I<sup>1</sup> am Dante<sup>2</sup>. You<sup>3</sup> are the Brown Band. I am to lead you through 
the bowel-like abyss of fumarolic<sup>4</sup> Hades<sup>5</sup>; the seeping quagmire of oozing 
Purgatory<sup>6</sup>; the festering pool of pusillanimous, pulsating, hemorrhoidal, pustul...anyway. 
You'll wish you were never born after I lead you through the nightmare of...high school literature.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band screams onto the field</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
The time: 1669<sup>7</sup>. The place: A Boston<sup>8</sup>  closet. You are the Reverend Chillingsworth 
Dimsdale Bakker beating yourself and feeling guilty over the adulterous relationship you've had with
 Jessica Hester Prynne...Hahn. During the midnight hour, you purge yourself of the filthy act you and she consummated 
 (even though it was the best sex you ever had). You should have just said NO<sup>9</sup>. Scourge yourself more. More.  
 More<sup>10</sup>! Oooh, that was great! Watch now as the band forms a big red 'A'<sup>11</sup> on the field and plays "Beat It."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>During the "more, more" bit, the band has been punishing itself enthusiastically. They now form an 'A' and play "Beat It."</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Now we move to the next circle.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Whistle blows. Band screams into the scatter</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Things are changing. It's getting dryer and warmer. There is dust in your nostrils. You are young Tom Joad returning from
 prison to find that fambly's<sup>12</sup> bagged your face. Mama, Roshasharn, Grandma, and everybody have headed west to
 California in the hopes of finding the promised land, a place where grapes are nice. Now you are Grandpa, a man who can't 
 button his pants without somebody's help. Actually things aren't that different. Now you're Ruthie searching for toilet 
 paper desperately. You ate canned peaches<sup>13</sup> and now you have skitters<sup>14</sup>, the trots, the runs, the 
 screaming meemee's, the liquid Lombardozi's. It's awful! The band now forms its award-winning<sup>15</sup> toilet paper 
 roll and plays "Hang on, Ruthie!"
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms a toilet roll and plays "Hang on, Sloopie!"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Now you're changing again. You're going up and down, up and down, thinking of nausea and too many Busch beers<sup>16</sup>. 
No, this isn't the band bus<sup>17</sup>, you've become Odysseus, trying to return home to Ithaca<sup>18</sup>, no, not Cornell, 
Ithaca, after 20 years. Long time since you got a little nookie<sup>19</sup>, isn't it? On your perilous travels you've met such awful creatures as:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A) Scylla and Charybdis<sup>20</sup>, the Greek version of Jim and Tammy Faye.</sli>
<sli>B) The Sirens<sup>21</sup>, the first Rock group.</sli>
<sli>C) Suzanne Vega singing "Calypso."<sup>22</sup></sli>
<sli>D) Like, the lotus flowers<sup>23</sup>, man. Really cool!</sli>
<sli>E) The horrible one-eyed Splooge<sup>24</sup>, and the worst, most disgusting monster of them all,</sli>
<sli>F) The Princeton Band<sup>25</sup>.</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
The only person who recognized you at home was the maid<sup>26</sup>. "Have a scar?" "No thanks. I don't smoke." The band now
 forms a doric column<sup>27</sup> on the field and plays "Heel of Fortune."
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms a marble pillar on the field and plays "Wheel of Fortune."</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Wake up, Band! You were having a nightmare! It's time to graduate! <sd>Band screams</sd> Be back in two months at Meehan 
Auditorium when we turn into the nation's only skating band and show that Yale is a modest school with much to be modest about<sup>28</sup>.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band marches off to "Ever True"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Notes: Actually the last line was supposed to be "Be back in two months when we turn into the nation's only skating band 
and play for a team that really appreciates us." See previous notes for various Rosenburg anecdotes. (What a craphead.) The 
only memorable factor of this game, besides Brown's almost losing to Columbia, was that it was butt-cold.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>The following are footnotes handed out to fans for this show, and corresponding to the footnotes indicated in the halftime script</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
(1) "I" - This is an interesting dilemma. Who is the "I" in this statement? It can't just be the voice of the band, for it's 
our show. Nor can it be considered my "I" either, for I wrote the thing for the band. See Benveniste's "The Place of Pronouns."
</sp>
<sp>
(2) "Dante" - Dante Alighieri of Dante's <i>Inferno</i> fame. 14th century Italian poet who wrote about the levels of hell. Cool idea, hah?
</sp>
<sp>
(3) "You" - See #1.
</sp>
<sp>
(4) "fumarolic" - like a fumarole. Smelly. Phew. Icky-poo. Bleck. Koodies. Ptui.
</sp>
<sp>
(5) "Hades" - where littled boys and girls in Greece go when they don't conjugate their irregular verbs. The Underworld. Home 
of such celebrities Cerberus, the two-headed dog; Sisyphus, the guy with the rock; and the boatman of the Styx.
</sp>
<sp>
(6) "Purgatory" - One level of Dante's schematic. Where people go to do penitence for the evil things they did in real life. 
Such examples of purgatory would be watching "Love Boat" reruns, cleaning up the band bus after a long trip, or coaching Columbia football for eternity. 
</sp>
<sp>
(7) "1669" - We wanted to say just 69, referring to an interesting sexual position, but our censor hasn't been getting any 
crumpet lately so we couldn't. See <i>Foucault's History of Sexuality</i>, vols. 6 and 9 details.
</sp>
<sp>
(8) "Boston" - not completely accurate. Hawthorne actually lived closer to Rte. 128. See Brigham's <i>Guide to Stuffy, Undersexed,
 18th Century Writers</i>, p. 1222.
</sp>
<sp>
(9) "...said NO." - This, of course, attributed to our First Lady Nancy Reagan. (We'll stop laughing when you do.)
</sp>
<sp>
(10) "More...MORE!" - Please excuse us if this paper is sticky at all.
</sp>
<sp>
(11) "red A" - the scarlet letter. Get it?
</sp>
<sp>
(12) "fambly's" - A fine example of Steinbeck's colloquial writing. Isn't he just GOD???!!!
</sp>
<sp>
(13) "peaches" - Cling peaches. Velcro. Hairball.
</sp>
<sp>
(14) "skitters..." - Digestive ailments. Diarrhea.
</sp>
<sp>
(15) "award-winning" - the Brown Band is proud to have won several awards this year: the Irvin Lustig Wangless Memorial; the 
Cliff-how-Long-Can-You-Hold-Your-Breath-Award; the Jay-Wah Stressing Out Plaque; the Boot Incarnate trophy; and Rob Howard 
won the Seditious Butthole-in-Waiting Ribbon. (Look, you don't have to read this, you know.)
</sp>
<sp>
(16) "Busch beers" - we figured that in 5 road trips, we drank about 40 cases of the stuff. And that was before any hard 
liquor. Cans now bear the legend "Official beer of the B.U.B."
</sp>
<sp>
(17) "bus" - see #16. Band buses are so much fun...so much that any knowing parent would take their child out of band so fast it'd make your head swim.
</sp>
<sp>
(18) "Ithaca" - Hellene Island off the west coast of Greece.
</sp>
<sp>
(19) "nookie" - this is not entirely accurate. While in Calypso, Odysseus managed to get quite a bit of trim.
</sp>
<sp>
(20). "Scylla/Charybdis" - a nymph-turned-monster who, with Charybdis, terrorized Odysseus and crew in the straits of Messina. 
The latter a daughter of Poseidon and Gaea condemned to the sea where by swallowing and spewing water she created a whirlpool.
</sp>
<sp>
(21) "Sirens" - scantily clad women who helped sailors get their rocks off.
</sp>
<sp>
(22) "Calypso" - Odysseus' lover for several years. A song by John Denver, who was also Odysseus' lover for several years.
</sp>
<sp>
(23) "lotus flowers" - peyote-like substance. See Hunter Thompson's <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>.
</sp>
<sp>
(24) "splooge" - Brown Band expletive. Ask one of us for its meaning.
</sp>
<sp>
(25) "The Princeton Band" - Gag. Vomit. Barf. Yack.
</sp>
<sp>
(26) "maid" - the maid was the only one who recognized Odysseus at first. What homer didn't say was where the scar was 
(heh-heh). <sd>Anal Retentive Editor's Note: Actually, Ben, he does. "The flesh above the knee" (Book 19, Line 492)</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
(27) "doric column" - though this might appear to be one last chance to get a gratuitous phallic formation on the field 
(which it is), it also shows the disparity in classical architecture: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian. See Bauman's <i>Anthology 
of Phallacious Truth in Architecture of the World</i>, vol. 7.
</sp>
<sp>
(28) "a modest [school] with much to be modest about." - Winston Churchill
</sp>
<sp>
I hope this has cleared up any confusion you might have had about this show. Thanks. This was fun. BKH.
