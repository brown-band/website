## Pregame

Presenting an organization that you'll have great difficulty in relating to even remotely, it's the Brown University "Jobeth Williams, Bless Armstrong, and Ted Turner to name only a few" Band!!

## Halftime

Please be advised that the following spectacle is laden with antics of a caliber only the Gods could appreciate fully. So don't worry if it goes right over your heads. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Homecoming Alumni, it's the Brown University "of course we can march, but thank God we don't have to" Band!

:sd[Band runs out in its best goofy form.]

For those of you unfamiliar with the Ivy League, we present a brief excerpt from the Barron's Guide to Overpriced Stuffy New England Colleges. Harvard comes first. Or so they tell us. Over and over and over again. Next is Yale – that's a four letter word. Then there's Princeton – they look dumb. And Cornell – they _are_ dumb. And of course Dartmouth – they don't even know they're dumb. And in the cellar because of their football team, student body, and endowment are Columbia, Penn, and Brown, respectively. But Brown students don't have inflated egos, unlike their Ivy League cousins. Just because we were voted the hottest college in the nation two years in a row, and appeared on the "Today" show, and placed tenth best college in a nationwide survey just last week, hasn't affected us one bit. Nahahhh. Watch now as the band salutes its modesty and plays "Really Awesome Stuff."

:sd[Band forms a '1' and plays "Hot Stuff."]

Gosh, it's great to be here. Just because we made the same trip 4 weeks ago doesn't bother us. We like driving through the scenic Bronx. We like seeing picturesque Newark Airport. And the meadowlands! Well, they are a sight to behold. Gosh, it's great to be here. In its travels today, the band is reminded of an old story which might sound like this: Yea, and go forth from the city of Galilea to Bethlehem. For there ye shall find a babe swaddled in spandex, looking mangy. And so 68 wise men traveled forth, following the lone star beer. And with them they brought mirth, son of Frankinsence, and gold. The band now salutes the spirits of Christmas by forming a New England blue spruce on the field. Gosh, it's great to be here.

:sd[Band forms a pine tree and plays "Oh, Little Town of Bethlehem."]

We realize the because of the disparitudes in our respective dialects which tend to make efficacious communication particularly infiltudinous and lobose, some of you may be experiencing inordinate obfuscation. Such is not the Weltanschauung of Universitas Brunensis. As we are fond of saying, "La plus ca change, la plus c'est me chose." We're sure you couldn't agree more. Leaving you to ponder the meaning of such Rhode Island expressions as "Seekonk," "Pawtucket" and "Sucking back a 'Gansett," the Brown Band now forms a raw clam on the field and plays "I'm Just Wild About Quahogs."

:sd[Band forms a clam and plays "I'm Just Wild About Harry."]

Be back next year when we won't.

Notes: Thanks to Peter Sultan, showwriter in 1985-86, for his U. Richmond show, most of which comprises this one. That was the show that never got used, due to some backwards thinking baptist in the U.R. Athletic Dept.
