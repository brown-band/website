Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you bum steers, presenting the only Band that never deals from a full deck, it’s the Brown University Royally Flushed Band!

Gambling has recently been legalized in Atlantic City, but few people realize that it’s been going around Brown for a long time. You gamble with your life when you go to Health Services, and with your health when you go to the Ratty. You gamble with your sanity if you take CS51, and with your virginity if you go to a frat party. Risking it all, the Band plays “Roulette the Barrel.”

:sd[The band forms a roulette wheel and ball; the wheel spins clockwise and the ball spins counterclockwise while the band plays “Beer Barrel Polka.”]

The spring sport of frat rushin’ roulette is a little different this year due to the presence of a sorority on campus. The female brothers of A D Phi must wonder whether the sisters of Alpha Chi Omega will take in male members. Or if not, will men eventually force their way in? Will the sorority get the dormitory the want, as they believe that “Diman is a Girl’s Best Friend?” Saluting these women, we play “Thank Heaven for Little Girls.”

Be back in two weeks when the Brown Band takes New Hampshire for granite.
