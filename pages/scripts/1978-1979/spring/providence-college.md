Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you half-court friars, presenting the only band that scores on every lay-up, from the finest basketball college in Providence, it’s the Brown University Technically Foul Band!

Joining the yearly horde of marginal prophets, we offer the following predictions for the coming semester: The BDH will interview themselves, publish their names, sue themselves for slander, and stand by their story. Brown will limit enrollment by accepting a finite number of freshmen to the class of 1983. Brown students will be snowed by the winter carnival. And Brown men will rise to a new challenge and at last uncover a treasure chest on Pembroke. To salute this achievement, the Band forms a treasure map where X marks the spot and plays “Mission: Impossible.”

Turning from treasure chests to measured bests, the Band locks at the 7 wonders of Brown University: New Pembroke — we wonder why the built it; University Hall — we wonder who George Washington slept there with; The Ratty — we wonder what it was we ate there yesterday; The Skating Band — we wonder about them sometimes, too; and Playboy — we wonder why they would want to photograph bear women. Honoring the chosen few, the Band plays “Satin Doll.”

Be back in two weeks when the Brown Band gorges itself on Cornell.
