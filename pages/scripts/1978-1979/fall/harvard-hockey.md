Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you high holiday cantor-bridgians, presenting, direct from a front page article in the <u>Brown Daily Herald</u>, it’s the Brown University Muckraking Band!

The BDH Band has a hot flash for you. Top notch investigative reporting has revealed that the winter carnival is a snow job. In reality, the flaky people on the UCS have been piling up a slush fund for themselves. They’re going to trade in the UCS van for an icicle built for two. But like any icicle, it drips when it warms up in the spring. The Band forms such an icicle and plays “Have You Never Been Melted?”

Having already gotten responses from several Brown women, the Band takes its poll to the rest of the Pembrokers. How do <u>you</u> spell BDH?

Following the BDH policy of revealing all, journalistic responsibility dictates that they disclose the names of the women involved in the 30 pregnancies on campus and the man responsible. As the scandal sheets roll off the presses, the Band plays “Hark the Herald’s Angles Stink.”

Be back in 8 weeks when the Brown Band once again scoops the Herald.
