Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you grosser greens, the Brown Band takes you back to the good old days, when men were men and women were chaste. Presenting the Brown University Catch as Catch Can Band!

:sd[Female band members run out, chased by the males.]

The Band would like to revive a veneered and timeworn tradition, the election of a homecoming queen. Brown’s Homecoming queen must bear herself well, must exhibit school spirits, must be a staunch supporter, and must be friendly and open to the entire student body. Meet a few of our candidates: Miss Taken, known for her weekend trips to Dartmouth, Miss Leading, known for her strange dancing; Miss Conception, noted for her fertile imagination; and Miss Demeanor, who faces the world with an ounce or less of happiness. The Band forms the 6 crown jewels of Brown University and plays Ain’t She Sweet.

We would like to introduce our judges, already trembling at the outcome—who will reign in Providence? Among this year’s judges are: the Dean of Iniquity, Dean Ounce, Dean Isle, Dean Tal Hygiene, and Dean Martin. The Deans have had their convocation and this year’s Homecoming queen has been elected--a surprise dark horse candidate! Bear she is, Miss Brunonia...

It’s our own ursine beauty! The Band salutes our Homecoming Queen, as we form a ruling sceptor and play “For Bruno and For Brown.”

Turning from Queens to Manhattans, the Band takes a slow comfortable look at the traditional post-game cocktail party, where your faculty is impaired and their pupils are dilated. Where alumni get together rehashing the past, chewing the fat, and beating around the same cla bushes. You find that your old girlfriend is now a mother and your roommate’s gotten bald at last. You mix with your old friends Margarita, Tom Collins, Rob Roy, and Bloody Mary. Downing its highball, the Band forms a cocktail and plays “Brandy Alexander’s Ragtime Band.”

Brown has been footballing for 100 years now. What Pembroker could forget the Iron Men of 1926? 100 years of Saturday afternoon scoring and downing Dartmouth’s offensive ends. The Band salutes the Brown booters of the last century.

Be back during hockey season, when the Brown Band stops making passes and starts scoring with a few well-placed pucks.
