Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you 4-H Farm Leaguers, presenting the scourge of New England, the Brown University Carberry High School Band, with drum major, Elrod #hitecomb, president, Buster Highman, and the Brazenettes, Bubbles and Boopsie.

:sd[Band marches on in straight lines playing “National Emblem March.”]

Traipsing down memory lane, the Band recalls that high school tradition, Senior Superlatives. How many of you were: Friendliest, Nicest Glasses, Most Bovine, Most Miscellaneous, Biggist Gossip, Most Effeminate, Biggest Boob, Most Likely to Take your own Life or Go to Cornell, or the Girl Most Likely. We recall also some of your favorite high school courses: foreign languages, where you learned French; classics, where you learned Greek; geometry, where you learned all the angles; and drivers’ ed., where you learned to park. The Band forms your vehicle of education and plays “Tijuana Taxi.”

Did you spearhead many extracurricular activities in high school? Were you involved in the Future Mothers Club, the Present Mothers Club, Future Cornell Students of America, the Debatable Club, the Chest Club, or Intravenous Sports? Remember the trauma of getting in to college? How personal was your personal interview? Did you score well on your SAT’s? The Band forms your letter from the college of your choice and plays “Another Opening, Another No.”

:sd[The Band forms a letter, opens the flap and plays “Another Opening, Anther Show”.]

You couldn’t get into the college of your choice, So here you are at Cornell. What with the size of the Cornell campus, you find you’re a sophomore before you reach your first class. Freshman year trauma at Cornell may include being thrown out of your room to make room for a cow, or finding that you now have a single because your roommmate’s gorge-ous swan drive and swan song are one and the same. You may be disappointed when your roommate’s plants turn up to be carrots, but worry not, The Band reminds you to check next door as it turns over a new leaf and plays “Happy Days.”

Be back in two years when the Brown Band gets high above Cayuga’s waters.
