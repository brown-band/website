Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the stadium…

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you waggish fops, presenting the only band to sit through 5 showings of “Heaven Can Wait” and not contract diabetes, it’s the Brown University “Bad News Bears Go to Providence” Band, Part 2.

Hollywood seems to have decided that one bad movie deserves another, coming up with such classics as “Damien Omen 2” and “International Velvet.” Jumping on the BANDwagon, we have recently put into production some sequels cf our own. Be on the lockout for “Heaven Can Wait a Little Longer” with Francisco Franco; “The Morning After the Night of the Living Dead,” with Julie Nixon Eisenhower; “TWO on One”; “A Star Reaches Puberty” starring Tatum O’Neal; “The Way We Still Are” with Dick Clark, and “Funny old Lady” with Ruth Gordon. Projecting bright future for these movies, the band spins its reels and plays “Another Opening, Another Show.”

As the Bionic Band runs into its next formation, we remind you that son you will be seeing TV sequels, such as that sequel to “The Love Boat” — “All My Children,” and “Found in Space,” starring the Yale Band. What with the high cost of intergalactic travel, it’s no wonder that Yale is having financial difficulties. The Band of course has SCIe money-saving suggestions. Yale could, naturally, elimiate their marching band, but that would be redundant. They might trade in the Yale Bowl for the Hartford Civic Center Bowl at its new reduced rate. Or the Yale administration could take tip from the Brown Band as we form a bouncing check on the field and play “Big Spender.”

Turning from wit to shortcomings in the Yale locker room, the Band salutes the Yale athletic program. Many people criticize the members of the Yale football team, but we would like to remind you of some of their positive qualities. They do meet three out of the four requirements for life. All of the members of the backfield are alingual. And 62% of them do have grade point averages. The Band salutes the Yale football team’s record of the last two years, forms a four-leaf clover, and plays “With a Heck of a Lot of Luck.”

Be back next year when the Band tidies the Yale Bowl.
