Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you freshman mothers and fathers, and their parents, presenting, direct from a syndicated column in the <u>New York Times</u> and the <u>New York Herald-Tribune</u>, it’s the Brown University Nothing to Write Home About Band.

Dear Band Landers,

My son Jack, off at college for the first time, has come up against some difficulties. After being assigned his room in Meehan Auditorium and meeting his 87 roommates, he discovered he had no Mode of Thought whatsoever.

Dear Atypical,

In spite of stiff competition, The Band would like to reassure you that your sons and daughters are making out wonderfully here at Brown. However, looking in at any dorm lounge indicates that the cramming has started early this year. The Band forms a full house and plays “25 Or 6 Too Many.”

But not all is amiss at Camp Bruno. We must thank the people who were kind enough to erect their tombstones all over campus so we could put posters on them. The South African Solidarity Coalition is still trying to keep South Africa solid. And in spite of the fact that the male-female ration has reached 50-50, the Band is sure that Brown men can still hold their own against Pembrokers. But we know there are also many things at Brown that work as often as the computers in the Ratty: the students, the pianos, the UCS, the organ in the French house, and those lethargic lifts, the Sci-Li elevators. The Band salutes the philosophy that one cut of three ain’t bad, as we go down in the single working Sci-Li elevator and play "Shaft."

Turning from melody to malady, the Band locks at Health Services, where the nurses are always willing to lend a hand. You might need to go there if you are suffering from any of the following ailments:

- A) the Ratty
- B) mental stress from your girlfriend breaking it off with you,
- C) vitamin D deficiency from the perpetual Providence sunshine,
- D) hydrocholoric acid bubbling out of your tube onto your hands in chem lab, or
- F) the Princeton Band.

During a physical examination your body is examined, your ears waxed, and you hold big breaths so the doctors can check the stability of your diaphragm. The Band forms an ambulance speeding you to the hospital, after you originally went in for a splinter, and plays “Tailgate Ramble.”

Be back in two weeks when the Band asks the musical question “Is Holy Cross just a bad habit?”
