Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you pusillanimous pussycats, presenting the only band to salivate before smelling the meat, it’s the Brown University Pavlovian Band.

The Brown Band is concerned for the Princeton student’s mental stability, with good reason. In a recently administered Rorschach test Princeton students indentified the following things in single inkblot:

:::script-list

- A) The persecution and assassination of Morat as performed by the inmates of the asylum at Cherbourg under the direction of the Marguis de Sade,
- B) The burning bush,
- C) Men on a bed,
- D) Coach Navarro,
- E) CEEB,
- and F) the Princeton Band.

Those who saw nothing in this Rorschach know what we see in Princeton. The Band forms and inkblot and plays “Hey, Look Me Over.”

The Brown Band has identified the following symptoms of that epidemic disease, Princetonosis. Some Princeton students attend eating clubs, where they learn to eat. Other Princeton students wear alligator contact lenses. Some have their SAT scores tatooed on their noses and their Achievments notched in their foreheads, and some have flaking and itching of the intelligence. The Brown Band suggests a cure for this awful disease, as we form the missing frontal lobes of the Princeton tiger and play “Feline Groovy.”

In an attempt to cure Princeton students inadequacies, the Band studies their childhood development. A consultation on sibling rivalry with Dr. Joyce’ Brothers indicates that their problems stem form being the Jung-est and from having been raised on the following foods: coma toast, Freud eggs, fetish cheese, hamnesia, and mixed nuts. The Band advises Princeton students not to be aFreud of the complex world as we make a Freudian slip and flay “Everything’s Coming Up Neurosis.”
