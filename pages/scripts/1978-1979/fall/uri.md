Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you unembraceable ewes, presenting, recently returned from a rousing, riotous, raucous, richly rewarding rambunctious romatic romp with reasonably rented Ramettes, it’s those travelling troubadors, That Roamin’ Band!

Toga on with the show, the Band invites you to Mt. Olympus, where Zeus’ lightning rod first struck. It was after this great mountain that the Olympic Games were named. These included the broad jump, and of course the Pole vaults, the predecessor to Swiss bank accounts. For Greek freaks, there was the high jump, and for all you URI students, the javelin catch. Io honor these sports, the Band forms a fifty-yard dash and plays “Wide World of Sports.”

Turning from Sports to forts, the Band takes you to a famous Greek council of war. “Homer gosh, Odysseus terrible,” cried Agamemnon. “All our efforts are Ulysses. Oh, what’s the Zeus? I’m losing Minerva, and Demosthenes tents are really terrible. The very Ares charged with excitement as the Greeks develop a plan. Commemorating the momentous occasion when the Greeks came through the gates of Troy, the Band forms a Trojan horse and plays “The Great Gate of Troy.”

Speaking of Greece, the Band slips into the Ratte. The Band psis as we witness food fight where we hardly eta thing. The culinary holocaust includes: Melon of Troy, Lambda chops, Alpha bits, popsicles, and of course, pie. Escaping from one classic disaster into anther, the Band forms a volcano, erupts on the field, and plays "Pompei and Circumstance."

Be back in two weeks when the Brown Toga Band invites the audience to take a sheet for themselves.
