Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Brothers and Sisters, and all you sacred cows, presenting, direct from a 40-year engagement moseying around in the Sinai Desert, it’s the Brown University Reigning Catechismic and Dogmatic Band!

Some day you Holy Cross sons of bishops may get to do your pope-graduate work at the College of Cardinals, where they learn Cardinal knowledge and other useful tricks like:

- A) parting the Red Sea,
- B) walking on water other than the Providence River,
- C) the Latin hustle,
- D) Sodom,
- E) Gomorrah, and
- F) the Princeton Band.

The College of Cardinals has once again proved that any little Polish boy can grow up to be Pope. He just has to click his ruby slippers together three times and say “There’s no place like Rome.” The Band forms a stream of white smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel and plays “Gospel John Paul II.”

The Band reminds you not to be an idle worshipper, but to rigidly adhere to the Commandments. We all know the top ten, but here are some up and coming singles. I am the Lord your Brown who hath brought you out of Worcester. Thou shalt not pre-rinse. Thou shalt not eat shepherds pie. Honor thy BankAmericard. Thou shalt not commit insects, especially your ant. Thou shalt not come early to social events. Thou shalt not end thy sentences with a proposition. The Band breaks the Ten Commandments on the field and plays “Big Sinnings.”

The Band salutes the bishoporic of Rhode Island with a moment of celibacy. Turning from mitres to martyrs, we would like to salute St. Casper the Holy Ghost, St. Joseph the Pain in the Aspirin, St. Louis the Blues, St. Saens the Composer, St. Xavier the Hollander, St. You a Letter Yesterday, and the patron saint of Worcester, St. My Kind of Icwn. The Band forms a halo and plays “When the Saints Go Marching In.”

Be back next year when the Brown Band celebrates a Worcester, Mass.
