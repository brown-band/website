Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization who loves to scat like Ella Fitzgerald, it.s the Brown University, defector I hardly know her, BAND!!!!!!!

The Clarkson’s weekly news publication, The Integrator, caused a media frenzy last week with its landmark exposé entitled “Choices of colonic proportions” by Matthew Lee. And I quote: “When it comes to the bathroom choices on campus the average defecator has a myriad of options.” Mr. Lee astutely pointed out: “Also, you would be crazy to not inspect the seat before sitting as you may encounter some presents left behind by someone of lower hygienic caliber.” Good advice for our modern era. While charting the highs and lows of his alma mater’s sanitary facilities, Mr. Lee focused even on the minute details. And I quote: “Harsh florescent lighting coupled with the worst example of human hygiene leads one to wish they had brought a spray can of Lysol before they sat down.” Watch now as the Band goes guano a guano and plays “Brown Eyed Girl.”

Clarkson recently had their annual winter exhibition, Winterfest, which included various activities including downhill canoe-ice-going. We the Band feel Brown should hold a similar event, only with better events, so as to upstage Clarkson. Our suggestions are:

::script-list

- A Ice skating while scantily clad in bathing suits. oh wait.
- B Starting a Group-Independent-Study-Project focused on gauging the socio-economic -effects of canoe-sledding on Inuit populations—grade option S/NC
- C Ice fishing in Providence River and we might finally find Vinny.
- D New IM sports such as Greco-Roman snowball fight and freestyle, half-pipe, sharp-shooting snowboarding jump
- E Start a Brown Curling Team because we would be automatic Ivy League Champions
- F (the Band responses): the Princeton Band!!!!!!!

Maybe next year Bruno will kick it freeze-school style. But, to hold you over until then, watch now as the band rides its snow-board over two moguls, and shows that snow lovin’ is better than no lovin’.

Recently, Brown announced that next year, students will have the option to live in doubles with students of the opposite gender. In response, Clarkson has announced that it too will offer co-ed housing to students in the fall. The move comes as a way to combat Clarkson’s extremely lopsided male-female ratio. Clarkson’s Residential Life Office has said that this would benefit all ten female students in addition to the lucky men who should have a better Valentine’s Day next year. Watch now as the band skates to “In the Fray,” and salutes the upcoming battle between the thousands of Clarkson men over these limited special accommodations.

Well, that does it for this magical night. Join Bruno and the Band tomorrow night as we Blitz the Pitz against Princeton. And wish us warmth as the Band ventures to the frigid north to battle Dartmouth next weekend.
