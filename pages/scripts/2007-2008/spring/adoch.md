Girls and Boys, future-Friends and future-future-Alumni, presenting an organization that matriculates three or four times a day and fives times a day on Sunday, it’s the Brown University, you can now do it in a gender-neutral double, BANNNNNNNNDDD.

It is unfortunate that those who decided to matriculate early could not come tonight. But we know that you all will be coming together this September. Deciding where to matriculate, is a very hard decision. We are not here to jerk you around, just rub you the right way. Watch now, as we drop all pretense of metaphor.

Recently the Pope decided to innovate on church doctrine and add 7 new deadly sins. Inspired by this papal initiative, the Brown University Band presents our list of the Seven Sins of ADOCH:

1. Don’t sexile your host(s) unless you are hooking up with the other one
2. Don’t forget that last PBR—Post Binge Recovery—before going home
3. Don’t Drunk dial your parents—DRUNK TEXT INSTEAD
4. don’t assume that a “smoke” is just tobacco
5. Hooking up—don’t tell your girlfriend
6. Hooking up—don’t tell your parents
7. Hooking up with girlfriend’s parents—definitely not okay

In order to drive our point home, watch the Band commit sin 7 and play a song dedicated to our favorite girlfriend’s mom.

We understand that some of you are looking at other schools, including our inferior ivy peers, URI, BYU, BJU, Liberty, and Deep Springs, but we would like to convince you of Brown’s superiority through the use of our rich tradition of interactive high-brow nuanced literary satire:

Hey guys, how many U Penn freshman does it take to screw in a light bulb? ...None, that’s a sophomore course.

A Yale man and a Harvard man race off a cliff, who wins? ...The WORLD, but specifically Brown.

And finally, for those of you unimpressed with the idea of living on a college campus, there’s always the University of Phoenix:

Thinking ahead—to when your education will rise out of the ashes of your first failed attempt at big people school.

And now for something completely different.

Following the age old tradition of lists from the Brown University Band, we will tell you “what Brown Can do for you”:

:::script-list

- A. We’re sixth on the Dream School list, but number one on the Wet Dream school list (you’ll be matriculating in your sleep).
- B. We have the second happiest students in the nation. (hey you try saying you go to school in Walla Walla, Washington without smiling)
- C. Sample semester: MCM0240 Television Studies, PHIL1520 Consciousness, MUSC69 Brown Band, UNIV0400 Beyond Narnia: The Political Theory and Writings of C.S. Lewis
- D. What’s that? We don’t have those here.
- E. Nakedness: you’ll have to matriculate to find out.
- F. THE PRINECTON BAND

Still not convinced? Then join us at Faunce House at noon tomorrow for a march to the activities fair because you won’t find the OMAC without us. And remember, Saferide only runs till 3 am, but for 15 cents on any RC’s door you can ride safely anytime you want.
