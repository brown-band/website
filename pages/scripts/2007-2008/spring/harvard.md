Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, Presenting an organization that is brining in the equestrian team to test the new pool for water polo, it’s the Brown University, neighhhh splash, BAND!!!!!!!!!!

This past week, Harvard’s student newspaper, “The Dark-Red-Hue,” joined in the 2008 election festivities when its editorial board endorsed Barack Obama and John McCain for their respective parties. Their support for Obama is clear, he graduated from Harvard Law School. However, McCain never rode the crimson tide. A more apt choice may have been Mitt Romney. He went to both Harvard Law and Business school, but I guess he forgot to send in his contribution check into Harvard’s endowment this year. Soon, the Brown Daily Herald will be publishing their endorsements. We humbly suggest they chose Ruth Simmons for the Democrats because of her commitment to awesomeness and Sean Quigley because he is the only Republican they know. Now watch, as the Band forms an exclusive monument and plays a national anthem, a song that reminds us of a place where hope and change are real.

Dateline: Cambridge, MA February 1 2008

This is your Harvard News round-up.

First, President Drew Faust, after sealing a book deal with the devil, recently published a book entitled This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War. In it, she uses the tragedy of the Civil War to exposit the nuanced nature of the Harvard-Yale fraternal rivalry, which they endearingly call their “Little Antietam.”

Second, the most distinguished scholar of Astrology and Alchemy the muggle world has ever known, J.K. Rowling will be giving this year’s commencement speech at Harvard’s graduation. It will be entitled: “Contemplative Studies meets Gender Studies: Albus Dumbledore.”

Finally, Harvard’s new financial aid program has brought joy to their campus. Steve, the student who will be affected by this new program, was overjoyed and used his I-Phone to instant-video-message his parents and tell them they would be able to buy that spare yacht next year after all.

Now, watch as the Band smiles and plays a tribute to Steve who can now have it any way he wants it.

Recently, thirteen members of the Harvard Class of 1967 sent a letter to President Faust accusing Harvard students of “widespread apathy and political indifference,” and asked her to establish a task force to investigate the issue.

In response, 420 members of the Brown Class of 1967 sent a letter to Ruth Simmons saying, “—wait—what—dude—” Ruth was greatly moved.

In one of the first moves since this enlightenment, Brown students have aided the fight against global warming by making Brown’s zamboni carbon-neutral and will soon be powered by Brown’s excess amounts of political involvement and student activism.

Watch now as the band takes the initiative to do something even Harvard doesn.t do, and skates to “In the Fray.”

Well, that’s a wrap. See you tomorrow night on for the home basketball game against Colombia. In the meantime, join the Band tomorrow morning at 8 am at Grad Center B outside Ben Bernstein’s window for a rousing rendition of “When the Saints Go Marching In.” And of course don’t miss our next ice show on February 15 against Clarkson.
