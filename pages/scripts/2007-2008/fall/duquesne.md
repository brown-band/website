## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and alumni, presenting an organization that rock and rolls all night and parties every day, it’s the Brown University “Duquesne, Duquesne, Duquesne, Duquesne, Goose-quesne!” BAND!

All summer, the band has waited for this moment. Right here, right now, this is what it’s all about. First football game of the year, and we’re playing…who? The Duquesne Dukes? And the award for the most unoriginal nickname in Division 1-AA goes to…you guessed it, these guys. What is a duke anyway? Some old English dude with a lot of land. In real life, any duke would run the other way when seeing a bear. On the gridiron, things are no different. Zak DeOssie may be playing on Sundays now, but there is still enough talent on the Brown bench to dominate. Watch now as the band forms a football and scores on Duquesne “Any Way We Want To.”

But enough about you, how has MY summer been? Here at Brown, things have been going swimmingly. The band practiced all summer, twice a day, learned 15 new songs, and finally decided to learn how to march---actually we all did “research” or had “internships.” How lame. Futures. Seriously though, the band has been looking forward to a great season, including such highlights as Harvard’s first ever night game. Watch now as the band forms a B and delibirately fails its classes so we can all be at “Brown Forever More.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that likes expectations nice and low, it’s the Brown University “Band” BAND!!

Coming back to campus is always fun. Seeing your friends, welcoming the freshmen, starting new classes, its all part of the college ritual. Those of us that have been her six or seven years may be getting tired of this, but we always have that third stab at calculus to look forward to. “Daddy, I know I would make such a good doctor but I just can’t pass any of the pre-med classes! Give me one more try and I promise I can do it.” Those of us who are seniors are looking out of the ivory tower, and staring back at us the REAL WORLD! AHH! Jobs, bills, kids, the thought of it all is just terrifying. If only we could be as the freshmen, frolicking on the main green without a care in the world. Want to take all intro courses? Sure! Don’t have any idea what you want to do with your life? Me either! Man, those were the days. Watch now as the band forms an ivory tower and yearns for the good old days when Michael Jackson was a cute kid with an afro by playing “I Want You Back.”

Speaking of the summer two years before an election, who do you think is going to win the presidency in 2008? Will it be Hillary, Barak, Mitt? While we don’t claim to be as knowledgeable as Tim Russert, the band would like to offer some things to watch out for as the election season nears ever closer.

:::script-list

- A. Next year, Mike Gravel will come out with a new commercial of himself staring into the camera, followed by him throwing a rock into a lake. Oh that happened? See, you can’t make this stuff up!
- B. Be on the lookout for an underdog to come in and take the election away from one of the main contenders. Sorry Senator McCain, you don’t count.
- C. More stock shots of Dennis Kucinich’s wife during debates.
- D. Every day is one day closer to not having to hear any more about the presidential election!
- E. Every day is one day closer to the beginning of the next round of election jibba-jabba!
- F. The Princeton Band!

Watch now as the band forms a butterfly ballot and plays the name we were called when abroad in Prague last semester.

Usually, halftime is a democratic institution, shared equally by bands from both schools. However, this week we have staged a hostile takeover of the Duquesne Band and stolen their show. They were going to make fun of us for having no grades and an ultra-liberal student body, but we ripped their script up. Instead we are going to form a B and play the Brown Cheering Song to drown out their imaginary sound.

Well that about does ‘er for us this week. Another day, another doggie to round up. But stay tuned, because next week we’ll be at Ha’vahd under the brand new lights. I heard the light is so brilliant it shines money, and that the campus walks are paved in gold. Are these rumors true? To find out, you’ll have to come.
