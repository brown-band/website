## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that microwaves itself every morning for breakfast; it’s the Brown University “your mascot is the oatmeal dude?” BAND!!!

The band has been doing some research on UPenn’s founder, and we’ve come to some conclusions about Ben Franklin. At best he was a reckless inventor and a mediocre politician. I mean, who in their right mind goes out in a storm and puts a key on a kite string? That’s asking to get electrocuted! Watch now as the band forms a key and plays the words Ben spoke after realizing that he had zapped his internal organs.

Aside from the Phillies and Eagles seasons, there have been a number of interesting developments this year at Penn. After heavy fighting resulting in thousands of casualties, Penn finally completed its hostile takeover of Drexel over the summer. Also, at a recent press conference, Penn State Football coach Joe Paterno (Brown alum from 1950!!) referred to his school as UPenn, thereby resurrecting that ever present ambiguity that Penn has sought to avoid, especially after the Smith-Patton Incident of 1957. Watch now as the band forms a B, remains above this controversy and plays “Brown Bear.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s following in its parent’s footsteps, it’s the Brown University “Mom, I’m joining the Peace Corps” BAND!

This weekend we welcome everyone’s parents to Brown. Mom, I hope you got my list of things I requested from home. They were:

:::script-list

- A. Bic rollerball pens. Black. And the 12 pack, not 6. I lose them ok mom!!?!
- B. Soap. I ran out weeks ago…
- C. Ping Pong balls, because I’ve taken up a new sport…
- D. Some new computer speakers. I spilled on my old ones.
- E. Money. This one speaks for itself.
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND

Watch now as the band forms the almighty dollar and plays “Stacy’s Mom,” because maybe she brought us some blank cds.

Parents are great. They love you no matter what you do. Almost. But the band still feels like they’re letting their parents down. What about Gandhi’s parents? They had something to brag about. Even Johnny Cash’s dad reconciles with him at the end of “Walk the Line.” Still, at the end of the day we know our parents wouldn’t trade us for anything. Watch now as the band shows some love and plays the proudest moment for Billy Joel’s parents.

:sd[Band forms heart, plays “Uptown Girl”.]

Parents weekend leads to the inevitable conversation that begins with the ten scariest words a college student can hear: What are you going to do with your life? Oh, that was actually nine words? Well then, I guess investment banking is out. The band really just wants to follow its heart and go pro in scramble band-ing. Seriously though, if anyone is looking for a witty writer with a strong humanities background and solid work ethic, contact the scriptwriter though email. Thanks in advance. Watch now as the band forms a B and enters into the Brown Alumni network “forevermore.”

Next week, the band travels to Yale. Grief counseling will be available in the rehearsal hall all week from 6-8.
