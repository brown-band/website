## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that isn’t afraid to clog its arteries, it’s the Brown University “Baconator? I hardly know her!” BAND!

On the way down to Columbia last night, the band stopped at Burger King and a philosophical debate ensued over the merits of the Quadruple BK Stacker vs. Wendy’s Baconator. Apparently, some people prefer a united attack of bacon on their mouth, while others love theirs in Lincoln-log fashion. They agreed to disagree and find common ground in their true love for the greasy mess of meat in their mouths. Watch now as the band forms the burger with inset bacon and pays tribute to the fourth meal with the playing of “Midnight Special.”

The Brown Band would like to take this opportunity to advocate on behalf of stew. For too long, stew has been a neglected part of many people’s definition of soup. We believe that stews of all kinds should take their rightful place next to chicken noodle and split pea soup. No longer shall stew remain in the shadows, unable to claim its heritage as part of the bowl-ed tradition of liquid meals. In honor of this noble food, watch now as the band forms a B and lets you know what our mascot would do to a bowl of stew.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves to pwn n00bs hardkore, it’s the Brown University “MAKE IT STOP!” BAND!

As this season draws to an end, we the Brown Band are reminded of the end of other great series. Harry Potter, the seventh book that devastated the world with the revelation about Dumbledore’s “orientation.” Who can forget Star Wars—but should we be remembering Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith—who knows? And of course, Lord of the Rings, the epic whose tragic hero, Gollum, we all love and miss. I guess all things must come to an end. Watch now as the band forms the One Ring, and signals the Final Countdown on the season.

Finally, this afternoon the band really just wants to dance.

We would like to thank you for a great football season. We know that you weren’t here for most of it, because we’re not in Providence, we’re in New York. But thanks anyway.
