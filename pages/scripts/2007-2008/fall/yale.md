## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s got an approval rating of more than 20%, it’s the Brown University “EVIL EMPIRE” BAND!

So Yale has Harvard on the run all the way to Canada. No, its not the Pequot War, I’m talking about GoCrossCampus, the online massive multiplayer Risk-type game currently being waged amongst the schools of the Ivy League. Columbia’s days are also numbered, and Dartmouth is on the ropes in northern New York. That leaves only Cornell, Princeton and us, noble Brunonia to defeat the evil Empire and conquer New England in the name of all that is good. Watch now as the band forms a **\_\_\_\_**, remembers the sport that is being played on the field and plays “NFL on Fox.”

In recent news, the Columbia army retook Jericho, and Yale defeated us at New London. This effectively leaves Brown at Mission Critical. Those backstabbing Columbians- we should have known! Even Napoleon got a second chance after defeat, and we’re still hoping ours comes. If not, we solemnly swear to defend Fall River to the death- Bruno does not go down without a fight! Also, who has been attacking those servers? Possibly an Eli? Watch now as the band rallys the troops, playing the Rhode Island classic “Brown Forever More.”

## Halftime
