## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that really isn’t so Awful Awful, it’s the Brown University “Rhode Island? How about Rogue’s Island!” BAND!!!

Today the band puts it all on the line, going head to head with the URI band for the coveted Governor’s Cup. This year, we are really going to try and win it. What? You have to march to win the Governor’s Cup? Well then, you guys can have it—but first, can we see it for a second? GULP! Now we are really ready for the game! Watch as the band forms the Cup, and plays the Fox Sports theme to get us all psyched up.

We really appreciate the extra effort the URI Band made by coming up here for this game. A source close to the Marching Ram Band told us that while en route, one of the trumpets finished his senior thesis by proving that it is possible to drive for an hour and still be in the state of Rhode Island. It’s really amazing what Sociology Departments are doing these days. Now that both bands are here, we say “Lets Get it On!” Watch now as the band forms a B, croons like Marvin Gaye, and plays “In the Fray.”

Half Time

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that wants an extra stuffie with that cabinet, it’s the Brown University “Buddy in 08!” BAND!!!

"It can be of little doubt that if the State of Rhode Island was separated from the Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under the popular form of government, within such narrow limits would be displayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities that some power altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule has proved the necessity of it.” What does this quote from James Madison, one of America’s founders, mean? Watch now as the band forms a factious majority, and uses these words as a Vehicle for discussion.

What Mr. Madison was trying to say was that if Rhode Island were to refuse to sign the Constitution, the nation would fail due to the weight of its competing factions. But times have changed, and Rhode Island is about so much more than that. It’s about coffee milk, Family Guy, and turf farming. What’s more American than that? Maybe the only thing the Brown and URI bands can agree on is that our state, whether we have lived here for only a year or our entire lives with no plans to move, gets no respect on the national stage. We demand recognition as the birthplace of religious toleration and the donut shop! Watch now as the band forms our favorite tasty snack and makes its demands known by playing “Gimme Some Lovin.”

Ultimately we must all ask ourselves this: what does it mean to be from Rhode Island? If you trust the words of Roger Williams, it’s a place where all people are free to worship and live as they please. What Cheer?! But, if you take the mascots of Brown and URI as guides, the only animal life in the state consists of Bears and Rams. Soon, however, the bears would eat all the rams, and reign supreme o’er Narragansett Bay. The band chooses the latter explanation, and relishes the chance to meet the URI band in head-to-head competition. Forming a B, the band plays “Brown Bear” to root its mascot on to victory.

Join us next week as Brown welcomes the Holy Cross Crusaders to Providence and gives them a lesson in math. 1+1+1=1????????
