## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has Nick Cannon on its drumline, it’s the Brown University “One band, one” BAND!!!!!

This weekend, the band welcomes all the alumni back for Homecoming. However, our parents are conspicuously absent. Their weekend is in two weeks. Why the need to separate the various adults that make it possible for us to be here at Brown? We love them all equally, and that goes for their financial stability as well. Without these fine people, we’d all be flippin’ burgers. But really, the band just wants to get down. Watch now as we form tiger eyes and play “Jungle Boogie.”

We also welcome the Princeton Tigers and their plaid-clad band this weekend. When we win this game today, we all plan on going to our fountain and playing Rock Lobster. Except the only fountain on our campus is pretty shallow and has what looks like a large string of beads in the center. We are going to do it though. Maybe. We still love Brown- that’s for sure. Watch now as the band demonstrates its commitment to the Brunonian cause, forming a B and playing “For Bruno and For Brown.”

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that takes all its classes S/NC, it’s the Brown University “There can’t be grade inflation without grades” BAND!!

The Princeton faculty has recently been pursuing a policy of grade deflation at Old Nassau. This has been seen as a shock to many Princeton students, who view their admission letter as a ticket to straight As and a bright future. WRONG! Daddy can buy you many things, but there’s no hiding the fact that you don’t do your reading and write bad papers. This trend has many Tigers wishing for days gone by. Watch now as the band helps them achieve their dreams, forming an A and playing “Time Warp.”

At Brown, every student loves the New Curriculum, and there is no grade inflation. We have prepared a short list that explains the subtleties of academics at Brown. When you take a class, the possible grades are:

:::script-list

- A. B
- B. C
- C. S
- D. A
- E. NC
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!!!

See, wasn’t that easy? Now the band will form a SciLi, study for its “Psychology of Grading” midterm, and play “I Touch Myself.”

Its all too easy to forget that Princeton played Rutgers in the first ever College Football game. The year was 1869; Ulysses S. Grant was the President of the United States. In what was a sign of things to come, Princeton lost that first meeting. Judging by the current states of these two football programs, it’s safe to say that there won’t soon be a debate about the best college football teams in New Jersey. Do the words “Championship Subdivision” mean anything to you? Probably not. By the time this history lesson is over, the band will have likely already formed a B. Watch now as they pay homage to the seventh oldest school in the country and proclaim the supremacy of “Brown Forevermore.”

Next week, the band travels to Cornell to take on the Reds. We will be joined on the field by Senator Joe McCarthy! Tune in to find out what hilarious antics ensue!
