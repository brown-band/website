## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization with more talent than Steve Miller, it’s the Brown University “No, we’re not going to play ‘The Joker’” BAND!

The Brown Band has not been to Cornell in four years, so we did some research to jog our memory of what it’s like up here. We found out some interesting things. You know, “You might think the Cornell campus is so big that it should have its own zip code. It is and it does. But one of the first things you’ll notice when you arrive is that student residences are organized into communities, designed with options, amenities, and recreational and learning opportunities that promote interaction and make the campus feel smaller.” Watch now as the band forms the McGraw Tower and keeps its housing options open, playing “Any Way You Want It.”

The motto of Cornell is, “I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.” Cornell is the federal land-grant institution of New York State, a private endowed university, a member of the Ivy League/Ancient Eight, and a partner of the State University of New York. It has been described as the first truly American university because of its founders’ revolutionarily egalitarian and practical vision of higher education, and is dedicated to its land-grant mission of outreach and public service. Watch now as the band forms the Dark Lord’s ship and pays homage to these ideals by playing a song that you already know.

Cornell was chartered in 1865. Opening Day ceremonies were held on October 7, 1868; the total enrollment was 412 students. Cornell’s colors are carnelian and white. By comparison, Brown was chartered in 1764. Its colors are cardinal red and seal brown. We here at the Brown Band love tradition just as Cornell does. That’s why we are going to play a very special song this afternoon. Watch now as the band forms a B and resurrects the “Pembroke Cheering Song”, from our old women’s college.

Tonight, look for the band at the Food Truck. Then it’s back to Providence. We hope that we’ll be missed.
