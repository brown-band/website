## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that takes theology pass/fail, it’s the Brown University “Crusader? I hardly know ‘er!” BAND!

The band welcomes Holy Cross this weekend, all the way from Worcester. All we have to say is, we are so happy it wasn’t an away game this year. Not that Worcester isn’t a nice city or anything, but it’s just not the kind of place that any of us want to spend another hour in- ever again. But seriously, we bet it’s a chill place once you live there for a while. Right. One thing we do love is football, and that’s what’s on the agenda for today. Today’s game promises to be biblical in scope, which suits the band just fine. Watch now as the band forms a fish and plays “Joshua.”

Initially, the band was exited by the prospect of traveling to Bury, England to play Holy Cross in football. But a quick check of Wikipedia revealed our mistake- at least ten colleges around the world are named “Holy Cross.” Come on, a little originality please! There are plenty of colors still available as college names. Taupe, Hazel, Mauve, and Fuchsia are all great options. Brown is taken, though. In case you forgot, watch now as the band forms a B and reminds you that we are loyal to Brown Forevermore.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that was founded on religious toleration, it’s the Brown University “In deo speramus!” BAND!

The year is 1492. Christopher Columbus has just landed on the island of Cuba. Thinking that it was actually India, he sets foot on shore and goes to look for gold, spices, and anything else of value. Flash forward to 2007. The band steps off into its own personal hell-- class! Last night we stayed up all night writing a paper. The assignment asked us to imagine being on Columbus’ expedition. What would you do when confronted with a vast unknown continent? What would you tell the native peoples living along the coast? Watch now as the band forms the Santa Maria, and channels the true Boss to explain our argument.

All the way to his grave, Columbus contended that he had in fact found a route to Asia. Now we know that in fact he was wrong, he had in fact discovered a new continent. Who wouldn’t want to claim that as one’s finest achievement? Amerigo Vespucci may have gotten to put his name on the New World, but Columbus is the one who we credit with the discovery. But why? This guy gets a national holiday named after him, but he wouldn’t even admit his feat!? Wishing he would at least own up to his part in the largest cultural takeover in the history of the world, watch now as the band forms a flag, claims its ground, and plays “My Continent.”

The band really does believe that all sides of Columbus’ story should be told. That’s why we have broken into the competitive world of publishing. Our first book is going to be called “Ride Me: The Story of Christopher Columbus’ Horse.” It tells the story of a young filly, Muffin, and her life of adventure. Born on a farm outside Seville, she was picked by Columbus as his most prized horse. She was on the Santa Maria during the first voyage to the Americas, and the book outlines her harrowing voyage below the deck of that famous vessel. Finally, it includes her untimely death, as starving crewmembers enjoyed her in a delicious horse stew. Look for it in bookstores this December- makes a perfect Christmas gift! But if that falls through, we always have music. Watch now as the band forms a B and plays the Brown Cheering Song.

Join us in Providence again next week as Brown welcomes Princeton for homecoming. The Princeton Alumni Association will be giving Rolexes to the first 500 fans, so get here early!
