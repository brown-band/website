## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that beat a Catholic school in football last weekend, it’s the Brown University “L’Chaim!!” BAND!

The band was extremely dismayed upon originally learning that this game was scheduled to be on the eve of Yom Kippur. Oy Vey! What’s a person (poisen) to do- watch Harvard alums cry while losing, or observe the most important fast of the Jewish year? While the choice was clear to those of us in attendance, the ignorance of the schedule makers was comical. How could you not know that it was Yom Kippur? At Harvard! It must have been that “world-class education” you’re all getting! Watch now as the band forms a dreidel and plays the only Jewish song we know.

Besides the lights, we’ve noticed some changes here in Cambridge, and I’m not talking about Drew Faust’s new pants suit. Apparently, Harvard has become Hogwarts over the summer. Just listen to this quote from the university’s website: “Harvard Square is a magical place, where centuries of tradition meet a cutting-edge urban sensibility. Every year millions of people are drawn here, from every corner of the globe. They come to learn, to teach, to discover, and to enjoy.” Honestly, that is the most ridiculous quote possible to be on the front of the Harvard website. The only thing to do in this situation is form a B and remind ourselves that we are all Brown People Born

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that looks just as good with the lights on, it’s the Brown University “I’ve got your Big Dig right here” BAND!!

With all the changes going on in Boston today, its no wonder most people didn’t care when Harvard installed new lights in their stadium. The Brown Band, however, likes the lights but is not sure of their ethical place on such a “progressive” campus as Harvard. Aren’t these lights contributing to global warming? We think so, and you know kids, if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. But wait- maybe the Harvard administration had an ulterior motive for these lights. Maybe they are sending mind-control waves down into our brains, making us believe that Harvard is everything they say it is?!?!? Watch now as the band forms mind-control waves, freaks out and plays “Crazy Train.”

How about the football game that’s been going on? Pretty good, eh? Actually, how would we know? We most certainly didn’t write this script during the first quarter. But the alto sax section did alert Brown Coach Phil Estes to some disturbing activities that were going on down on the Harvard sideline. It seems one of the Crimson’s coaches was videotaping our defensive calls and telling his players when we were going to blitz— Oh wait, that was the other football team from Massachusetts, and we’re not talking about UMass. Watch now as the Band circles the wagons to protect the integrity of the game and tells the Harvard’s coaching staff to “Beat It.”

In related news, the Band is here to announce that rumors of Britney Spears’ comeback have been greatly exaggerated. Her performance during the most recent MTV Video Music Awards had many of our members rushing to record companies looking for deals as pop stars. But Diddy didn’t bite our sales pitch, so don’t hold your breath waiting for a Brown student to become the next Hilary Duff. Who are we kidding, anyway? When the artist formerly known as Mrs. Federline’s career becomes such a joke that she plays the halftime for the Harvard Yale game, we would be happy to be her backing band. After all, her dancing is about as good as our singing. At least we try- sometimes. Watch now as the band forms a B and plays the Britney Cheering Song.

:sd[Band forms B, plays #2.]

Join us next week for a stuffie and some chowdah as Brown welcomes URI to Providence. “Ram ‘er? I hardly know ‘er!”
