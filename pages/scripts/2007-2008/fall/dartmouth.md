## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s happy its not Hanover in New Hampshire, it’s the Brown University “Green is the color of puke” BAND!

The band was extremely happy to not make the trip up to Dartmouth this year. Its not that we don’t like the wilderness, it’s just that we wouldn’t want to go to school there. We would, however, enjoy going to Australia, home of the Dartmouth Dam on the Mitta Mitta River. We hear the trout fishing is great! We would also surely enjoy a cruise on the HMS Dartmouth, a World War I light cruiser. Triple Alliance, beware the Brown Band! Whatever Dartmouth you choose, make sure it’s not Dartmouth College. Watch now as the band forms New Hampshire, and explains how we leave the Live Free or Die state.

Dartmouth’s motto is a clear sign that all is not right on Wentworth Street. In Latin, it is “Vox clamantis in deserto,” which translates as “The voice of one crying in the wilderness.” This is not the uplifting motto that we would like to see from an Ivy League institution. “In deo speramus:” now there’s a motto! “In god we hope.” Word up. There’s no crying in the liberal arts! Well maybe there is sometimes, if you really need an extension because your computer broke and your cousin is in the hospital…. Watch now as the band forms a single tear and plays “I Want You Back.”

In order to really drive our point home, the band would like to close our halftime show with a list of reasons why Rhode Island is better than New Hampshire.
