The Brown Band was really excited when it heard something primitive emerged from the Harlem River…then we found out it was Fordham. But that’s alright, We’ve been studying to speak your language, so straight from Vatican I, Latinam Est! Nos pedis pilam amamus et Nos Brownum amamus. Speramus Bruno lauriferem est! Quod volimus laetificare nostram classem ad victoriam, Brown Band Faciebit pilam pedis et cantabit "LUDES VULPIS!"

:sd[Band forms football and plays Fox Sports.]

O Me Hercule!, Fordham itaque pessimus est! E via, si tu potes comprehendere hic, bonus tibi et tu requires novam harundinem! Audivisne iocationem "Semper Ubi sub Ubi"? Ego non secuutum sum illis! Ecce iam ita Brown Band facit "B" in agro et cantat Ad Bruno et Ad Brown.

With the debate over Evolution in schools being so prominent in the Nation Consciousness, The Brown Band felt it would do what it could to devolve the tension, instead of just Millerin’ around. One idea was to follow in Darwin’s footsteps and go to the Galapagos Islands to see firsthand what Darwin’s was talking about, but right before we left, we found a Finch in our Atticus, which killed 2 Mockingbirds with one stone. To symbolize our quest for the end of the debate, the Brown Band will form our favorite part of Greek life and play "From Alpha to Omega"

:sd[Band Forms Omega and plays "From Me to You"]

Continuing on our quest to select what’s most natural, the Brown Band was greeted by a giant flying spaghetti monster that proclaimed his way was the only path to peace on this issue. Not one to miss out on the "Spagfestivities," the Brown Band sat down and chewed on what our Ziti- faced Friend had to say. After Learning about connection between pirates and global warming, we were touch deeply by our friend’s Noodly appendage. To symbolize exactly how intimately we were touched, the Brown Band will form our friend and play Pretty Flying Spaghetti Monster Guy

Ending our search for the answer to the debate, we went to Fordham to seek counsel as a last resort. We figured Fordham’s Skreet Smarts would lead us to a solution, but when we got there, we found out that Chevey had been chased and this caused us to abort our brainchild. Watch now as the Band forms a "B" for the Bad case of Bronxitis we caught while visiting, and reminds you to only visit Fordham "In the Day"

Join us Next week as Bruno will welcome Princeton’s big tail and make a list A through F (The Princeton Band!) of all the things Princeton can do with that cannon.
