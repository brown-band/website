## Pregame

Presenting an Organization that steals the Harvard drum as often as it can, It’s the Brown University, "Restraining Order? I hardly know HER!" Band!!

As many of you know, the Brown Band and Harvard have long and sordid history together. And although we tried the keep our dirty laundry separate, The Brown Band has decided via the smell test that the odor is not that strong. Being the Emilio Cleptovez of the Ivy’s, the Band has been thinking of other things to abscond with from Harvard.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen Friends and Alumni, Presenting an Organization that vote George Clinton in ’94, it’s the Brown University, "Awww yeah" Band!

The Brown Band has just undergone a revolution. It was not televised, it was not advertised, but it was funkified! We guarantee this is an A-train that will keep you groovin’ for more. The Band has made it its mission to make you feel it all over, and we figured if any fellow Ivy needed some help getting some soul, it was Harvard. We checked your hep box for some funky freshness, but all we could find was lameness. Presenting What gruesome squareness Lurks in the hearts of Harvardites, the Brown Band will demonstrate how truly destimulatin’ the Harvard soul is and play "Mrs. Robinson."

:sd[Band forms Box and plays Mrs Robinson.]

Don’t worry Harvard jive turkey’s, The Brown Band gots ta not leave ya’ hangin’. We tried to poll you guys on things that were Rick Jamin’ freakin sweet so we could know where to start with funkification. This is what you guys came up with:

:::script-list

- A) Tweed
- B) No confidence votes in the President of the University
- C) MIT Geeks, cause they have more fun
- D) Clapping off beat to music
- E) Being Wide and Deep
- F) The Princeton Band!

From the looks of it, we are going have to start with the disestablishment of Harvard Square, So watch now as the Brown Band forces Harvard to Give up the Funk and Tears the Roof off this sucker!

:sd[Band Forms Tall house with detached Roof and plays "Tears the Roof off the Sucker."]

To the Brown Band’s dismay, our attempt to open Harvard’s groove has failed. You are going to need the help of the President of the United States of America-funk. We called him up for you guys, but he said Wonder Bread makes him queasy. But see, we feel for you Harvard, so we’ll go the extra yard, Be Funky Walkers and Dirty Talkers, and ask you one more time to "Bring the Funk"

:sd[Band Forms B and plays "Bring the Victory"]

Sorry Harvard, we only have one thing to say, "Welcome to Squaresville, population: YOU!" Peace out!

:sd[Band plays #1 and marches off]
