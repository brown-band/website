## Pregame

Presenting an Organization that knows how to dampen your campus EEEE. It’s the Brown University “For a good ’ol 5 cents you can smoke my cigar” Band!

:sd[Band Runs on]

90 years ago the Ramming began for the Governor’s Cup. And Bruno gave back the cup, but made sure it was empty. 90 years later, Bruno is emptying its cup, and URI’s campus is left high and dry. And according to a recent poll 9% less than 69% of URI’s Campus believes the football team is funded too heavily. The Brown Band feels for URI’s football team and wants to show URI how to feel the love. As a result, we’ve begun’the novel “Governor’s Bowl.” More inclusive than the cup, the bowl will move to support higher education as well as a sense of community. And all those participating will get a complimentary tote bag too! So Watch now as Brown Band inhales together and deeply and plays “Friendship”

But really, The Brown Band understands how far you had to travel to get here, and appreciates the effort. As a fellow university of Rhode Island, the Brown Band feels we should treat each other as family with a Rhode Island accent. Making you an offer you can’t refuse, the Brown Band will form a B for Mob Boss, relax in its kickbacks, and put on its cement shoes and play, “Drown Forevermore.”

## Halftime

Presenting and Organization whose Bari Sax section’s BAC is higher than the average URI student’s GPA, it’s the Brown University “NO! IN UR EYE” Band!

:sd[Band runs onto the field]

The Brown Band has been trying to learn all it can about its collegiate next-door neighbor. And sure enough, URI’s back door was open. We found out that this week was diversity week at URI, and the Band couldn’t be in support of it more. With a student population from exotic lands like Seekonk, Warwick and Block Island, such a week is certainly a good thing for fostering international relations at URI. Finally, all those Rhode Islanders can be exposed to the exotic and primitive ways of the Long Islanders. Aside from this, the Brown Band found out International Drug Expert Dick Pound came to speak at URI this week. The Band was really upset as our level of expertise on the matter would have been just as good, and would have only cost half the price. But to show that there’s enough peace to go around, the band will form a peace pipe, and answer the question, “What is Dip?”

Further immersion into the URI student scene yielded a startling revelation: you’re hopes for a new concert hall is shattered too! Being the helpful Band “with a conscience” that we are, The Band has been thinking of ways URI students can raise funds. One Idea the band had was to create the “URI For the inadequate guy”. With this program, URI students could raise money serving as an inspiration to others, showing them how things could be worse as big guys, with a minimal quid- pro-quo-state of mind. Another idea is the “Jamaica? I hardly know ah!” Program, where Brown would donate a Main part of the Green to making Kingston Rasta-fantastic. Well, if none of these ideas will work, you could always do a bake sale. And because we care, watch now as the Brown Band bakes up some tasty snacks for you and plays “Midnight Special Brownies.”

After hanging out with you, the Band has realized that although we are neighbors, we really don’t want to have a neighborhood Block Island party with you. Its not us…its you. We are just too different. You say “sawr” and we say “saw,” you guys Ram, and we Jam. But we hope there is no ill will, as you do play all our Brown songs. In the spirit of this fact, watch now as the Brown Band, forms a B and plays, the Brown Sharing song.

Join us next week, as Brown Bears face Fordham at Home and, the Band asks, for the second time in a month, the question “JesuWHAT?!”

:sd[Band Marches Off to #1]
