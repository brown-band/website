Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's here to help save the day, it's the Brown University "it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman! No wait, it's Superman's less impressive, less well-known sidekick" BAAAAANNDDDDD!!!

You may have noticed the Band is not attired in its typical regalia. Tonight we're exposing ourselves - letting you all know that we are, in fact, superheroes. Well, almost. We stand before you a band of faithful sidekicks, doing our best to make sure that our heroic companions' alter egos are protected and their hero underwear are dry-cleaned and starched. We're on the sidelines, cheering on our heroes as they skate around and try to score points against opposing hockey teams - oops, almost divulged their secret identities! Watch now as the Band forms Mighty Tighty Whities and plays Pretty Fly for a Sidekick Guy.

Being a sidekick can be tough - everyone loves the hero, but when does the sidekick get any love? In fact, most sidekicks end up completely forgotten. Here's a list of sidekicks you've probably never even heard of:

:::script-list

- A. Backseat Driver Boy
- B. The Credible, Inedible Egg
- C. Mildew Man
- D. The Human Puddle
- E. Lieutenant Less-Obvious, and
- F. The Princeton Band!

When will these hard-working helpers ever get their due? Watch now as the Band forms a Sidekick and plays More than a Sidekick.

For years now, the Band has been happy to play second fiddle to our heroic hockey team, but it's time for us to take the spotlight. Just as Syndrome turned on his fellow citizens after being spurned by Mr. Incredible, just as Cubby staged a mascot coup to overtake Bruno, now the Band has claimed the ice for our own nefarious purposes. But we won't stay long because as they say, you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. We're not quite sure where that leaves us though, so for now we'll just enjoy the attention and serenade you with one more song.

Watch now as the Band does the unthinkable and plays while moving.

That's all for this group of chipper companions. Catch the Band at our next ice show, joined by our beloved alumni, on February 28th! Brown Band out.
