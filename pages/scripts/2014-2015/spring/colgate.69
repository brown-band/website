Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's welcoming back its alumni 
with open, frosty arms, it's the Brown University "there's snow place like home" BAAAAAND!
</sp>
<sp>
Today we have a really special show for y'all because our alumni are here! Their hair is almost as white 
as the ground outside. When they heard us complaining about all the snow Providence has been buried 
under, they tried to regale us with tales of walking to class in the snow uphill both ways-then they 
looked around and realized that we actually do have it worse this year. They'll probably be glad to get 
back to their relaxing retirement homes, where they have only 18 inches of snow and it's a toasty 35 
degrees every day. Watch now as the band forms a Snow Man and plays Snow-l Man.

So in case you've somehow missed the snow pyramids on the main green and the Russell Carey email shenanigans, 
Providence has become a frozen wasteland. In fact, the only grass we've seen in months has been wrapped in paper. 
And you thought that the piles of snow were high! Thankfully, being reunited with our alumni has been almost 
enough to warm our deeply, deeply frozen hearts. We just need to watch out for the monster icicles that have 
been forming around campus-if we're not careful, one might fall and penetrate us. Watch now as the band forms 
an igloo for...protection...and plays the Ding Dong Song.

In addition to being an institution which somehow tricks students into spending four years in Hamilton, New York, 
Colgate also produces toothpaste! You wouldn't catch us using it, though. Here is a list of things we would rather 
put in our mouths than tubes of Colgate toothpaste.

That's it for us-we hope you've enjoyed watching the beautiful reunion between young and old bandies banging and 
blowing. Catch the band at the women's basketball game on March 7. Brown Band out!
