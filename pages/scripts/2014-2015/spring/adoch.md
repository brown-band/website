Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s so glad to meet you, it’s the Brown University "the children are our future" BAAAAAND!!!!

Hey everyone, welcome to Brown! We hope you’ve been enjoying the whirlwind of people, activities, and mild terror that is ADOCH. We’re the Brown Band, and we’re here to tell you what’s hot and what’s not. Hot: The Ratty! Not: Real food! Hot: Concrete skyscrapers! Not: Atmospheric study spaces! Hot: being done with the college application process! Still hot: ADOCH! Definitely hot: Matriculating at Brown! Hope that crash course in what’s cool was helpful – watch now as the Band forms half an onion ring and plays The Impression of Brown That I Get.

We hope you’re enjoying your first taste of College Hill. Looking back on our own college decision processes, we’re sure you’ve already met some really… interesting other prospective students at all the schools you’ve visited. Here’s a list of people you’ve probably met in the last month:

:::script-list

- A. Mr. "when my father was here..."
- B. Ms. "So what did you get on your SATs?"
- C. The person who already feels like your best-friend-soulmate-twin even though you just met
- D. That kid who won’t stop talking about how they’re going to join the Brown Band
- E. The football recruit, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

And of course, there are millions more amazing kinds of people you can meet if you come to Brown in the fall! Watch now as the Band forms the dark side of the gibbous moon and plays Stacy’s Alma Mater.

We can’t wait to see you in the fall, especially if we happen to run into you at a Brown Band rehearsal! And as always, remember to matriculate early and often. Brown Band out!
