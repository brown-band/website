Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s elated not to be wearing its snow boots anymore, it’s the Brown University “check out our shiny new rainboots!” BANDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!

:sd[Read in the most rock-concert voice] What up, Brown University? We’re your spring weekend headliner, Lauryn Hill! We meant to be here for spring weekend last year but we’re really, really, really :sd[ad nauseum] late. But at least we’re not running as late as the spring is - we thought we might have to ditch this field show and lace up our skates instead. But spring is on its way, and with it, mud-wrestling season. And nothing goes better with mud-wrestling than some groovy tunes. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the last act of last year’s spring weekend...

One advantage of starting spring weekend on our favorite day of the weekend, Thursday, is that it is incredibly unexpected and therefore a good opportunity to practice being stealthy. For some tips on stealth, we turned to our declassified guide to life, WikiHow. Here are some of the top tips we took away:

:::script-list

- A. Practice by sneaking up on a squirrel
- B. Memorize the definition of being hard to see
- C. Learn to creep
- D. Flow with the terrain
- E. Embrace the thrill, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!!!

Watch now as the band forms a Stealthy Anthropomorphic Reptile and plays Build Me Up Buttercup - if you can find us!

From our years of experience doing stealth shows, we know that no one can hear what we’re saying right now, so we’re going to take this opportunity to air some of our grievances - and believe us, we have plenty. Number one - how dare you? Also, why didn’t you come to our birthday party? Also, why aren’t we allowed to use the phrase “douching with holy water” in a field show? Why is our math TA’s voice so annoying? Why does my skin hurt? And for those of you who did come to our birthday party, why didn’t you get us the Barbie Universe Cinderella Princess Dream Castle we asked for? Why?

Watch now as the band forms B as in Barbie and plays Four Bruno and Fore Brown.

That’s it for us - thanks for what we can only assume will be a rousing round of applause as soon as we finish this show. Catch the Band at Relay for Life on the Main Green on April 11th. Brown Band out!
