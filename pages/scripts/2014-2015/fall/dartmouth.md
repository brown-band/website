## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that can't tell a pass from a fail, it's the Brown University "a D is the good one right?" BAAAAAANDDDDD!!!!

We just learned about Dartmouth's unique academic calendar, which allows students to pick which seasons they want to be on campus in Hanover. We thought that sounded pretty cool, but then we learned that they can't choose "none". The reason for this plan is so they can "fit 4,000 students in 3,000 beds," and it's called the D-Plan. We have our own version of the D-Plan at Brown, but it's about everyone's least favorite D- the grade D. We don't have that at our school.

Watch now as the Band forms a nonexistent grade and plays "I Go to Brown".

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization which is made stronger by the haters, it's the Brown University :sd[(sung to the tune of "Beautiful" by Christina Aguilera)] "words can't bring us down" BAAAAAANDDDDD!!!!!!!!

Itâ€™s that time of the year again - time to read some fan mail. This one comes to us from J.E. Tribble in Plymouth, Massachusetts. In 1968, J.E. was really blown away by one of our field shows. Quote, "This bunch of pseudo-sophisticated semi-intellectuals should be prevented from representing and disgracing Brown again. What a shame that these children were allowed on the same field with the football team. I would suggest that you suspend all Band activities for the rest of the year. Then hire a new band director who will do away with the slapstick attitude that pervades this group of shuffling minstrels. Hopefully, he can make a band out of them." Thanks for the letter, J.E.! Expect your genuine all-plastic Brown Band kazoo in the mail soon.

Watch now as the Band blows a kazoo and plays "Come Out and Fly, My Pretty".

We're sure there are a lot of cool stuff going on at Dartmouth right now, but we're not really interested in that. Instead, here's a list of things.

:::script-list

- A. Cats coughing up furballs,
- B. Bulldozers,
- C. First-generation iPod shuffles,
- D. That thing where you think you have a skin condition but it's actually just leftover Cheeto dust settling into the crevices of your skin,
- E. Sheep in tall grass, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Anyways, here's Wonderwall.

To make sure our show was as funny as possible for all of you, we enlisted the help of the funniest people we know: random children from the internet. Here are some of the best jokes they came up with: "Who is the biggest man? No one you are all the same size." "What do you call a dinosaur with no eyes? Shut up." "What will you do if a monkey is trapped in an island? Do nothing, cause you didn't know cause you're far away from the island." "A man goes to the doctor and said 'doctor I think I have something stuck in my throat.' So the doctor said 'let's take a x-ray.' (This doctor did not know about spines.) He said, 'I see the problem a bone is there.'" Thanks, kids!

Watch now as the Band forms an "X" and plays "In the Fray".

That's all for now. Catch us back at home next week for our final game of the season, against Columbia's fightin' Lionel Richies. Mmmmmmmmmmmbye!.

:sd[Instead of roll-off into #1, script reader plays #1 on a kazoo while the Band marches off.]
