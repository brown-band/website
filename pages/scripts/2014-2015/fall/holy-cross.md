## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just gargled with holy water, it’s the Brown University “minty freshness that only the Holy Spirit can provide” BAAAANNNND!!!!!!

We wish we could share this game with our friends in the Holy Cross Crusader, Hit and Run, Giant Killer, Neutral Field, Pull Through the Clutch, Never Say Die, Have Ticket Will Fly, Have Coffee Will Sober, Legendary and Notorious, Tug of War, Apple Corps, Halloween Howling, Rugby Shirt Erasing, Only Undefeated, Papally Blessed, Award Winning, Lost in Paramus, Cigar Smoking, Push It, Tone Deaf, Waterlogged, Self-Important, “Got There, Got There,” “Our Power is Beyond Your Understanding”... ugh, this is taking a while. Watch now as I catch my breath and the Band plays “Come On Eileen”.

As I was saying… Lush and Haunting, Feeling the Unit, Topless on the Turnpike, Visually Stimulating, Sublimely Sybaritic, What About Bob?, Band is Safe Sex, Maximum Capacity, March to the Arch, Turning Over a New Rob, Holy Cross College High School, “Tell Me!,” Harnessing Our Inner Chu, Brrreakdown, “Less Poncho, More Feeling,” Off We Go... to Ramapo??, Dancin’ in the Street, Stop and Watch the Ivy Grow, Band in Foster Care, Dressed to Impress, Sparkly Yet Intimidating, Probably Overcompensating for Something with All Of These Names, “Goodtime” Marching Band! Unfortunately, they couldn’t fit all their names on one bus, so they stayed home. What a loss. Watch now as the Band embarks on a crusade and plays “Bring the Victory”.

The Holy Cross “Goodtime” Band may not be here, but we can still show you a good time!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that enjoys a hearty “Hosanna” with vigorous jazz hands :sd[Band makes vigorous jazz hands], it’s the Brown University “Sparkly Yet Intimidating” BAAAAANNNND!!!!!!

Last weekend, Holy Cross hosted the New England Collegiate Marching Band Festival. They were kind enough to invite the Brown Band to perform, leading us to believe that it has truly been too long since our bands were in the same stadium. Out of respect for the dignity of the other bands in attendance, we decided to withhold the glory that is our performance and share it with you all today instead. In fact, we’re hoping this will count as the first of our miracles on the way to sainthood. Prepare to be converted and bask in the joy that is the Band sprouting angel’s wings and playing “Saintly Soul Man”.

We had to find some way to fill our day when we decided not to attend the marching band festival. Here are the things we wholly crossed off our to-do lists:

:::script-list

- A. Broke nine of the ten commandments before getting out of bed,
- B. Added an eighth to the list of seven deadly sins,
- C. Snacked on some communion wafers,
- D. Wrote 99 theses,
- E. Had impure thoughts, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Watch now as the Band baptizes itself and plays “Livin’ on a Prayer for our Heathen Souls”.

As you can tell, last weekend was not our holiest. We’re doing our best to make up for it now. This is how confession works, right? We’re not familiar with this whole “penance” thing, so here’s some music instead. Watch now as the Band absolves itself of sin and plays “Brown Man Born”.

That’s all for now. Follow the Band down the Jersey Turnpike next week as Brown takes on the fightin’ Princetons. Brown Band out!
