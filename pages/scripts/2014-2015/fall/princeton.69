Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that came here to get a date, it's
the Brown University "we're saving ourselves for halftime" BAAAAAND!!!!!
</sp>
<sp>
A recent study found that Princeton's alumni are among the least dateable, according to research from
an online dating site. But we've been on those dating sites<smdash/>we're not sure how great a judge of
dateability those people are. We prefer FarmersOnly.com (a.k.a. Cornell University Alumni relations),
and those websites for single parents. Watch now as the band forms its dating profile picture and plays
Dating Stacy's Mom.

Not satisfied to let this story go un-researched, the Band deployed our best investigative journalists to
figure out just what makes Princeton alumni so unappealing. Here's what our sleuths discovered.
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. They think that Halloween colors are appropriate to wear at all times of year,</sli>
<sli>B. They're unwilling to travel outside their eating clubs in choosing date locations,</sli>
<sli>C. Tigers are relatively hostile,</sli>
<sli>D. They think plaid goes with anything,</sli>
<sli>E. They didn't get us a 250th birthday present, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

Watch now as this group of eventually more dateable future alumni forms a B and plays "For Bruno and
For Brown."

<sp><sd>Princeton and Brown Bands perform a joint halftime show. The two script readers are distinguished 
by their school name as well as bold font for the Brown Script Reader. </sd></sp>
<sp>
Princeton: Re-enacting our glory days at the Citadel, it's the Princeton University Band!
</sp> 
<sp> <b>
Brown: Whoa, what are you doing here? Excuse me. Still welcome at the Citadel, it's the
Brown University Band!
</b> </sp>
<sp> Princeton: Hey this is our show, get outta here </sp>
<sp> <b> Brown: No, you get outta here. </b> </sp>
<sp> Princeton: Well... you first. </sp>
<sp> <b> Brown: Ugh <sd>  napoleon dynamite style </sd> </b> </sp>

<sp><sd> The Princeton and Brown bands charge onto the field.</sd></sp>

<sp> <b> Brown: It's a tale as familiar as a tiger's - two lovers kept apart by an endless feud. Shakespeare said
it best in his classic story, Brunoneo and Princetoniette: </b> </sp>

<sp> <b> Two universities, both alike in dignity,<sbr/>
In fair New Jersey, where we lay our scene,<sbr/>
From ancient eight to modern football games<sbr/>
Where civil sports make civil jerseys unclean.<sbr/>
From forth the fatal loins of these two schools<sbr/>
A pair of star-cross'd bands take the stage<sbr/>
Whose misadventured scrambling overthrows<sbr/>
Do with their songs bury their teams' rage </b></sp>

<sp><b>Watch now as the Brown and Princeton Bands join forces to recount a bittersweet tale of
forbidden love. </b></sp>

<sp><sd>The Bands form a heart and play "The Impression That I Get."</sd></sp>

Princeton: A poem from the Princeton University Band. </sp>

<sp>In New Jersey, the Tiger Band,<sbr/>
A stately pleasure-dome decreed<sbr/>
And soon we hoped from Providence-land<sbr/>
the hunky-chunky Brown-Bear band,<sbr/>
would run to us with hugs and glee.</sp>

<sp>But soft! What light from yonder grandstands breaks!<sbr/>
It is the East, and Brunoneo is the sun!<sbr/>
With no-one else do we have such fun,<sbr/>
As Brunoneo<smdash/>O the ruffles his fur makes</sp>

<sp>And on his furry forehead these words appear:<sbr/>
"Hello my name is Brunoneo, lover of lovers..."<sbr/>
O!<sbr/>
Our mind is numb, our thoughts are junk,<sbr/>
Our mouths are dumb, our words are gunk,<sbr/>
O brownie love, we're in a funk,<sbr/>
Our hearts drink up, our love is drunk.</sp>

<sp><sd>The Princeton Band forms a mug of stout and plays "Love Drunk". The Brown Band fills in the
glass.</sd></sp>

<sp> <b> Brown: A poem from the Brown University Band: </b> </sp>

<sp> <b> A band from Rhode Island we are<sbr/>
We saw orange plaid from afar<sbr/>
You tickled our fancy<sbr/>
We got rather antsy<sbr/>
How did our pants become ajar? </b></sp>

<sp><b>A rivalry keeps us apart<sbr/>
We've admired you right from the start<sbr/>
Do you like us or no?<sbr/>
Will you please be our beaux?<sbr/>
Be careful with our fragile heart.</b></sp>

<sp><b>We wait now to hear your reply<sbr/>
"Please love us," we desp'rately cry<sbr/>
We can't wait to trombone<sbr/>
Soon we won't be alone<sbr/>
In the meantime let's lower our fly.</b></sp>

<sp><sd>The Brown Band forms unzipped pants and plays "I Touch Myself." </sd></sp>

<sp> Princeton: The story of the star-crossed bands only gets better. After exchanging countless letters like these and
serenading each other's dorm windows on Saturday mornings before football games, Brunoneo finally
asked Princetoniette out on a date. To the carnival. And she said yes! First they went on the rollercoaster and held paws the whole way. Later that afternoon they took a little rowboat into the Tunnel of
Love... and got lost until the next morning! They were just fine, but Princetoniette had a big surprise.
Joining together again to unveil the couple's happy news, the band forms the growing Princetoniette on
the field and plays "Gimme Some Lovin'." </sp>

<sp><sd>The bands form a P and play "Gimme Some Lovin.'" Partway through the P becomes a
Pregnant P, which also looks like a B. Go figure.</sd></sp>

<sp><b> Brown: The baby's half-tiger, half-bear, oh my! After a war that seemed like it would never end, there
is a glimmer of hope on the horizon; a bouncing baby boy, Johnny, has united the previously
divided institutions. As he grows, so will the newfound peace between Brown and Princeton.
Johnny will truly B. a Goode omen for the future of these two clans. The only question left is
where he will go to college... and what kind of college accepts a half-tiger half-bear student. </b> </sp>

<sp><sd>The Bands form a baby-like creature and play "Johnny B. Goode."</sd></sp>
