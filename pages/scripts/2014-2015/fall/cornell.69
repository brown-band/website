Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that no longer has to worry about

We're pleased to welcome the Cornell University Band to the game. We're amazed that they were able
to take enough time away from running the Big Red Hotel to make it to Providence. Here's a list of
things that will be neglected while the band's away:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A.	Mucking out the stalls,</sli>
<sli>B.	Putting down fresh hay,</sli>
<sli>C. Sloppin' the pigs,</sli>
<sli>D. Replacing all the tiny soaps and putting mints on the pillows,</sli>
<sli>E. Rooooom service! and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>Watch now as the band delivers room service and plays "Tear the Roof Off the Hotel."</sp>

This weekend has been an opportunity to reunite with our families, who we can only assume are here to
try to reign in our rambling antics. Little did they know, our antics are too strong and we convinced them
to join our ranks. If you ka-zoom in on the band, you'll notice that they're with us right now, tousling
our hair and getting schmutz off our faces. Mo-om!

That's all for now. Enjoy the game and don't forget to call your parents.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves animals, it's the Brown
University "Dartmouth University" BAAAAANNNND!!!!
</sp>

Welcome to the Brown University family weekend show! We're glad to be with our loved ones this
weekend. Unfortunately, the deer population of Ithaca is not so lucky. Cornell has been suffering an
overpopulation of deer lately. After an abstinence-only education program failed to lower deer birth
rates, the university instead turned to sterilizing the female deer. While the birth rate dropped, the
numbers of mate-seeking bucks skyrocketed, so the population remained steady. Next time, try sending
your extra deer to Dartmouth. They'll know how to *take care* of them.

With such an abundance of deer running around, Cornell should capitalize on the opportunity to add a
unique new item to the menu of their second Yogurt and Dairy summit, which was recently held on
campus. The summit brought more *culture* to Ithaca than the university has seen in years. We could
go on and on about this Dairy Summit business, but we don't want to milk this joke too much <smdash/> that
would be too cheesy.

Not satisfied with merely two agriculture-related events going on, Cornell is also getting ready to host
the 28th season of the Ornithology Lab's FeederWatch, dedicated to the only thing more boring than
watching birds in real life <smdash/> compiling data about birdwatching. But it still falls into the top three most
popular activities at Cornell, right after watching grass grow and watching paint dry. However, this work
is pretty important as it will help track the numbers of bushtits and yellow-rumped warblers, which we
can only assume are vying acapella groups on campus.
