Welcome to the Brown Band's Halloween show! You may have noticed that we're not attired in our usual style.
Figuring we might get up to some spooky mischief this weekend, we decided it would be best not to rep our
school colors around Philadelphia. Then we remembered that we have no desire to be outside in Philadelphia
anyway. If we had remembered that, we could have just worn our birthday suits. Watch now as the Band rings
the Liberty Bell and plays "Ghostbusters."

In the spirit of Halloween, we were inspired by Jimmy Kimmel to convince our children that we had eaten all
of their candy. However, we soon realized that we don't have any children, so we decided to try it out on the
Penn band instead. We tried to take candy from them, but all they had was toast. They're like the college
marching band equivalent of the old people in the neighborhood who only give out raisins and toothbrushes.
We took the toast anyway. At least it's better than oatmeal. Watch now as the Band forms a B in a piece of
toast and plays "Brown Cheering Song."

That's all for now! Enjoy the game and don't forget to brush after all that candy.

A recent UPenn study posits that people toward the lower end of an esteemed group tend to name-drop membership
in that group more, citing its own students as an example of this status-defending behavior. The study's head
researcher stated, "As members of the Ivy League, Penn undergrads bring up the Ivy League more, since they are
Ivy League students pursuing an Ivy League education." The researcher, herself a Penn alumna, added, "My Ivy
League degree from Penn really prepared me for rigorous research here at Penn. In the Ivy League." Who knew
Penn State was so prestigious? Watch now as the Band forms a single ivy and plays "I'll Make an Ivy League Man
Out of You."

This year's class of seniors are eagerly awaiting Commencement and being free from Penn. They're especially looking
forward to writing "Penn '15" on their resumes and nametags in the future. Can't see any way that could backfire.
Watch now as the band forms the graduating class and plays "Hold On I'm Comin'."

New statistics indicate that ten American billionaires graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. That's pretty
cool, but amazingly, it's not the most exciting thing about Penn. Here's a list of groups which are also disproportionately
made up of Penn grads.

<sul>
<sli>A. Inadvertent members of the Penn State Alumni Association,</sli>
<sli>B. Tuition-payers for current Penn students</sli>
<sli>C. Professional former athletes</sli>
<sli>D. Almost-billionaires who are just as successful, damnit!</sli>
<sli>E. Full-time Benjamin Franklin impersonators, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

See? There's more to life than money, especially if you went to Penn.
