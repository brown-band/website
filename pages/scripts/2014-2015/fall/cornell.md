## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that no longer has to worry about form-altering extraterrestrials, it's the Brown University "now we just have to deal with our parents" BAAAAANNNND!!!!

We're pleased to welcome the Cornell University Band to the game. We're amazed that they were able to take enough time away from running the Big Red Hotel to make it to Providence. Here's a list of things that will be neglected while the band's away:

:::script-list

- A. Mucking out the stalls,
- B. Putting down fresh hay,
- C. Sloppin' the pigs,
- D. Replacing all the tiny soaps and putting mints on the pillows,
- E. Rooooom service! and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

:::

Watch now as the band delivers room service and plays "Tear the Roof Off the Hotel."

This weekend has been an opportunity to reunite with our families, who we can only assume are here to try to reign in our rambling antics. Little did they know, our antics are too strong and we convinced them to join our ranks. If you ka-zoom in on the band, you'll notice that they're with us right now, tousling our hair and getting schmutz off our faces. Mo-om!

That's all for now. Enjoy the game and don't forget to call your parents.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that loves animals, it's the Brown University "Dartmouth University" BAAAAANNNND!!!!

Welcome to the Brown University family weekend show! We're glad to be with our loved ones this weekend. Unfortunately, the deer population of Ithaca is not so lucky. Cornell has been suffering an overpopulation of deer lately. After an abstinence-only education program failed to lower deer birth rates, the university instead turned to sterilizing the female deer. While the birth rate dropped, the numbers of mate-seeking bucks skyrocketed, so the population remained steady. Next time, try sending your extra deer to Dartmouth. They'll know how to \*take care\* of them.

Watch now as the band forms the status of buck mate-ability and plays "A Hard Deer's Night".

With such an abundance of deer running around, Cornell should capitalize on the opportunity to add a unique new item to the menu of their second Yogurt and Dairy summit, which was recently held on campus. The summit brought more \*culture\* to Ithaca than the university has seen in years. We could go on and on about this Dairy Summit business, but we don't want to milk this joke too much — that would be too cheesy.

Watch now as the band forms Mary Moo Cow and plays "My Sharona".

Not satisfied with merely two agriculture-related events going on, Cornell is also getting ready to host the 28th season of the Ornithology Lab's FeederWatch, dedicated to the only thing more boring than watching birds in real life — compiling data about birdwatching. But it still falls into the top three most popular activities at Cornell, right after watching grass grow and watching paint dry. However, this work is pretty important as it will help track the numbers of bushtits and yellow-rumped warblers, which we can only assume are vying acapella groups on campus.

Watch now as the band forms its favorite bird and plays "Brown Threevermore".

:sd[Band forms a B and plays "Brown Forevermore".]

Follow the band to Penn next week as we take on the fightin' Pennies. Brown Band out!
