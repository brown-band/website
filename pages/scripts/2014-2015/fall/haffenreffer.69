Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that<smdash/>despite years of
research<smdash/>still has no idea where Cotton-Eyed Joe came from or where he went, it's the Brown
University "I have no idea what I'm doing" BAAAAAAAND.

You may be wondering why today's script is horribly unfunny. Actually, you might not have
noticed that yet, but you will shortly. After all, this whole thing is just a filler so you
can learn how to scramble. That reminds me: SCRAMBLE FASTER. Don't worry, the real shows will
be funny. At least I hope they will be. If you know any jokes, now would be a good time to
tell them to your neighbors. Oh, here's a good one: Did you hear the one about the invisible
man and invisible woman having kids? They weren't much to look at. OK that was bad. Maybe this
one is better: Last week I went to a seafood-themed disco. I pulled a mussel. Anyway, make the
first form already. I gave you a lot of time.

At this point you probably just want me to stop talking. But this whole thing is for your benefit.
I think. I'm not actually sure. At this point I'm just talking to hear my own voice. Don't stop
scrambling. Keep running around like chickens with their heads cut off. How long do you reckon you
have left until you need to be in the next form? Here's a helpful countdown: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4,
3, 2, 1, 1/2, 0. Time's up. Let's see how our B looks.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that can't wait to form its
first phallic shape of the year, it's the Brown University "Insert dick joke here" BAAAAAAND!
</sp>
<sp>
I have completely run out of original filler at this point. In its place, today's halftime show
is a cluster-fudge of unwitty banter, useless information, and shamelessly ripped-off jokes. How
about some uninteresting facts to start? This works well with the mandatory list.

<sli>a) You can die from breathing for an extended period of time;</sli>
<sli>b) You can't breathe while swallowing;</sli>
<sli>c) Telephones don't have any eyes;</sli>
<sli>d) At any given moment in time, there are a LOT of people on the Internet;</sli>
<sli>e) Snow becomes yellow when you pee on it. I know this because a friend told me; and</sli>
<sli>f) THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

Watch now as the Band forms a truly perfect circle and plays whatever the hell it wants.

This next section is a compilation of one-liners from various comedians. And by "various comedians"
I mean mostly Mitch Hedberg. Here we go.

<sli>"I'm against picketing, but I don't know how to show it."</sli>
<sli>"What happened when Jesus wanted to swim?"</sli>
<sli>"Onions make me sad. A lot of people don't realize that."</sli>
<sli>"It always feels better to have a wank with a dead arm; but apparently I ruined that funeral."</sli>
</sul>

That last one transitions nicely into our next form. Watch now as the Band forms something that is totally not a penis and plays "Ding Dong Song".

Crap, I've completely run out of jokes. How about some totally legitimate facts? These have been personally verified.

Well, that's all the time we have today. Phew, that was getting tedious. Join us next weekend to see the Band
face off against Hahvahd under the lights. For now, Brown Band out.
