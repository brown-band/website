## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s been counting down the minutes till this show, it’s the Brown University “3...2...1...” BAAAAAAND!!!!!

Welcome to the Brown Band’s first field show of the semester! It’s great to have an audience for once; we’ve been in this empty stadium for the last 250 years, practicing day and night to ensure that this was going to be our best show ever. We’re confident that—like a fine wine—our humor has aged so well that you’ll be too drunk to be sure whether or not we’re actually funny. Watch now as the Band forms dear Brunonia’s age and plays “Time Warp”.

We’re thrilled to welcome back so many of our alumni to the band tonight! We’re amazed they made it up the hill considering how fragile their joints are. Good thing they could spare the time away from their bridge games and shuffleboard at their retirement homes. We’re overjoyed that they’re able to spend some of their golden-Brown years with us.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that just got accepted into Walmart, it’s the Brown University “Harvard was our safety” BAAAAAAND!!!!!

Wow, we’re not used to seeing so many fans here to support our team. A turnout like this only happens once every 250 years. Speaking of which, a lot has changed since Brown was established all those years ago. Back then, we didn’t even have a football team; and in 2014, it looks like Harvard still doesn’t.

Business Insider recently published a list of things harder to do than get into Harvard. Here are a few that were left off the list:

:::script-list

- A. Learning object permanence
- B. Putting on Velcro shoes
- C. Spreading the bubonic plague
- D. Boiling water
- E. Obeying the force of gravity, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

Wow, that’s some tough stuff! Watch now as the Band attempts to boil water and plays “Smooth”.

A recent survey of Harvard alumni revealed that only 66 percent of them feel that their work is making the world a better place. We can only assume that those 66 percent work in the field of convincing high schoolers not to attend Harvard. To those brave men and women doing such essential work—we salute you.

We hope you enjoy the rest of the game and stick around later for some “explosive” entertainment. Brown Band out.
