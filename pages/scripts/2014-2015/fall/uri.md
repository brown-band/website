## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that’s been traveling for days, it’s the Brown University “we took the long way around the earth” BAND!!!!

We’re happy to have arrived here in Kingston. We were a little worried about finding parking for our buses, but we were able to stash them in a large dirt parking lot next to the Kingston Emporium. Unfortunately, we quickly found ourselves about to be towed. Thankfully, we found that this particular towing company, which will remain nameless, accepts personal “fines” to be paid directly from towee to tower. We were able to squeak by with a payment of a few Rhode Island staples: Paw Sox tickets, coffee milk, and of course, hot wieners, otherwise known as gaggers. Watch now as the band forms a gagger and plays “The Hot Wiener Song.”

We wanted to extend our congratulations to URI graduate Mat Franco, who won America’s Got Talent two weeks ago for his skills as a magician. We’re sure his illusions and sleight of hand are spectacular, but we’re not too impressed. After all, you may boast America’s most talented magician as an alum, but does that top Hermione Granger, Brown Class of 2014, also known as the best and brightest witch of her age? I don’t think so. Watch now as the band flies along in style and plays “Final Countdown.”

With college first-years just settling into campus life, URI tweeted a helpful list of how to be a successful student. We think the list left off some important items.

:::script-list

- A. Get your fill of hot wieners in the Butt,
- B. Eat so much that your freshman 15 fills the entire state of Rhode Island,
- C. Stand out from the crowd by raising 18,000 weevils,
- D. Drink plenty of coffee milk to fortify your bones and keep yourself energized,
- E. Call your parents, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

:::

Following these steps is your key to success. Watch now as the band becomes a “B” and blasts “Brown Bear.”

That’s all for now. Hope you’ve enjoyed our musical RAMblings. Brown Band out.
