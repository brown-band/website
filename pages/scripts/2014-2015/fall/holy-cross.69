Last weekend, Holy Cross hosted the New England Collegiate Marching Band Festival. They were kind enough to invite 
the Brown Band to perform, leading us to believe that it has truly been too long since our bands were in the same 
stadium. Out of respect for the dignity of the other bands in attendance, we decided to withhold the glory that is 
our performance and share it with you all today instead. In fact, we're hoping this will count as the first of our
 miracles on the way to sainthood. Prepare to be converted and bask in the joy that is the Band sprouting angel's
 wings and playing "Saintly Soul Man".

We had to find some way to fill our day when we decided not to attend the marching band festival. Here are the things 
we wholly crossed off our to-do lists:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A.	Broke nine of the ten commandments before getting out of bed,</sli>
<sli>B. Added an eighth to the list of seven deadly sins,</sli>
<sli>C.	Snacked on some communion wafers,</sli>
<sli>D.	Wrote 99 theses,</sli>
<sli>E.	Had impure thoughts, and</sli>
<sli>F.	THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp>
Watch now as the Band baptizes itself and plays "Livin' on a Prayer for our Heathen
Souls".

As you can tell, last weekend was not our holiest. We're doing our best to make up for it
now. This is how confession works, right? We're not familiar with this whole "penance"
thing, so here's some music instead. Watch now as the Band absolves itself of sin and
plays "Brown Man Born".

That's all for now. Follow the Band down the Jersey Turnpike next week as Brown takes
