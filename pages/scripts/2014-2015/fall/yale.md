## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization with plenty of real-world skills, it’s the Brown University "social aptitude" BAAAAAND!!!!

Yale’s computer science department is currently considering a collaboration with Harvard in which Harvard’s CS50 class lectures would be live-streamed into Yale classrooms. The class focuses on practical, "real-world" skills, which Yale’s CS department seems to be lacking. "Call it a Harvard-Yale game of CS," said the chair of the Yale CS department. The chair of the Harvard CS department responded, "You could call it that... but that makes it sound like we care at all."

Speaking of practical computer science problems, a pair of Yale alumni recently developed a social networking app called Huddlr, intended to help students on campus find social events. One of the app’s co-founders said, "I’m all about solving real-world problems." We’re glad that these entrepreneurs are tackling the urgent issues of the day. Forget hunger and war-Yale students are bored on Saturdays! Students across campus are thrilled that their most pressing struggle -developing and maintaining a social life- has been eased by this technological advancement. Feedback from the student body has shown overwhelming support of this endeavor. Said one junior, "I probably won’t use it. If I want people to know where I am, I’ll just tell them."

That’s it for now. Enjoy the game and if you’re feeling lonely, don’t forget to Huddl.

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that hopes this script lasts long enough, it’s the Brown University "it’s not the length of the script but how you read it" BAAAAAND!!!!

The Yale football team recently began following a "new-trition" program to improve players’ athletic performance. The New Haven Register said of the program, "The players are bigger, faster and stronger. They are recovering faster. Other teams are wearing down late in the game. Yale isn’t." We hope this bodes well for their stamina in other areas. Toiling in the library, that is.

Watch now as the Band pumps iron and plays "Come Out and Play...and Play...and Play".

The prestigious Yale Bowl was featured in a recent New York Times blurb in honor of its one-hundredth anniversary. The article features enlightening details, such as the fact that the stadium didn’t contain bathrooms until the 1930s and still has no locker room for the football teams. Because of this, the article explains, players dress in a separate building and walk to the stadium, strolling past tennis courts and a row of portable toilets- defining features of Yale and New Haven, respectively. We can only imagine this has led to some confusion over which dirty bowl is the toilet and which is the stadium.

Watch now as the Band drops the kids off at the pool and plays "Fox Sports".

In addition to not spending money on locker rooms, Yale just launched a new and exclusive credit card program. Cards can be adorned with classic Yale imagery like the color blue, a bulldog licking itself, or the skyline of New Haven, entirely in the dark. Yale community members are excited to get out and start spending. Here’s a list of the first things they’ll purchase with their new plastic.

- A. A ticket out of New Haven,
- B. Bathrooms for the Yale Bowl,
- C. George Bush’s artwork,
- D. Retroactive admission to Harvard,
- E. More credit cards, and
- F. THE PRINCETON BAND!

This initiative will surely be the economic boost needed to bring New Haven out of the Dark Ages.
