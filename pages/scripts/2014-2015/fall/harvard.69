Ladies  and  gentlemen,  friends  and  alumni,  presenting  an  organization 
that's  been  counting  down  the  minutes  till  this  show,  it's  the  Brown 
University "3...2...1..." BAAAAAAND!!!!!

Welcome to the Brown Band's first field show of the semester! It's great to 
have an audience for once; we've been in this empty stadium for the last 
250 years, practicing day and night to ensure that this was going to be our 
best show ever. We're confident that<smdash/>like a fine wine<smdash/>our humor has aged 
so  well  that  you'll  be  too  drunk  to  be  sure  whether  or  not  we're  actually 
funny. Watch now as the Band forms dear Brunonia's age and plays "Time 
Warp".

We're thrilled to welcome back so many of our alumni to the band tonight! 
We're amazed they made it up the hill considering how fragile their joints 
are.  Good  thing  they  could  spare  the  time  away  from  their  bridge  games 
and  shuffleboard  at  their  retirement  homes.  We're  overjoyed  that  they're 
able to spend some of their golden-Brown years with us.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that 
just got accepted into Walmart, it's the Brown University "Harvard was our 
safety" BAAAAAAND!!!!!

Wow, we're not used to seeing so many fans here to support our team. A 
turnout like this only happens once every 250 years. Speaking of which, a 
lot has changed since Brown was established all those years ago. Back then, 
we didn't even have a football team; and in 2014, it looks like Harvard still 
doesn't.

Business  Insider  recently  published  a  list  of  things  harder  to  do  than  get 
into Harvard. Here are a few that were left off the list:
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Learning object permanence</sli>
<sli>B. Putting on Velcro shoes</sli>
<sli>C. Spreading the bubonic plague</sli>
<sli>D. Boiling water</sli>
<sli>E. Obeying the force of gravity, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>

Wow,  that's  some  tough  stuff!  Watch  now  as  the  Band  attempts  to  boil 
water and plays "Smooth".

A recent survey of Harvard alumni revealed that only 66 percent of them 
feel that their work is making the world a better place. We can only assume 
that  those  66  percent  work  in  the  field  of  convincing  high  schoolers  not 
to  attend  Harvard.  To  those  brave  men  and  women  doing  such  essential 
work<smdash/>we salute you.

We  hope  you  enjoy  the  rest  of  the  game  and  stick  around  later  for  some 
"explosive" entertainment. Brown Band out.
