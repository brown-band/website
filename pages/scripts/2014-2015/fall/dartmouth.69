We just learned about Dartmouth's unique academic calendar, which allows students to pick which seasons 
they want to be on campus in Hanover. We thought that sounded pretty cool, but then we learned that they 
can't choose "none". The reason for this plan is so they can "fit 4,000 students in 3,000 beds," and it's 
called the D-Plan. We have our own version of the D-Plan at Brown, but it's about everyone's least 
favorite D- the grade D. We don't have that at our school. </sp>

<sp> Watch now as the Band forms a nonexistent grade and plays "I Go to Brown". </sp>

Itâ€™s that time of the year again - time to read some fan mail. This one comes to us from J.E. Tribble in Plymouth,
 Massachusetts. In 1968, J.E. was really blown away by one of our field shows. Quote, "This bunch of pseudo-sophisticated 
 semi-intellectuals should be prevented from representing and disgracing Brown again. What a shame that these children 
 were allowed on the same field with the football team. I would suggest that you suspend all Band activities for 
 the rest of the year. Then hire a new band director who will do away with the slapstick attitude that pervades this 
 group of shuffling minstrels. Hopefully, he can make a band out of them." Thanks for the letter, J.E.! Expect your 
 genuine all-plastic Brown Band kazoo in the mail soon. </sp>

We're sure there are a lot of cool stuff going on at Dartmouth right now, but we're not really interested in that. 
Instead, here's a list of things.</sp> 
 <sul>
<sli>A.	Cats coughing up furballs,</sli>
<sli>B.	Bulldozers,</sli>
<sli>C. First-generation iPod shuffles,</sli>
<sli>D. That thing where you think you have a skin condition but it's actually just leftover Cheeto dust settling 
into the crevices of your skin,</sli>
<sli>E. Sheep in tall grass, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>

Anyways, here's Wonderwall.

To make sure our show was as funny as possible for all of you, we enlisted the help of the funniest 
people we know: random children from the internet. Here are some of the best jokes they came up with: 
"Who is the biggest man? No one you are all the same size." "What do you call a dinosaur with no eyes? 
Shut up." "What will you do if a monkey is trapped in an island? Do nothing, cause you didn't know cause 
you're far away from the island." "A man goes to the doctor and said 'doctor I think I have something 
stuck in my throat.' So the doctor said 'let's take a x-ray.' (This doctor did not know about spines.) 
He said, 'I see the problem a bone is there.'" Thanks, kids! </sp>
<sp>Watch now as the Band forms an "X" and plays "In the Fray".</sp>
<sp><sd>Band forms a B and plays "In the Fray".</sd></sp>

<sp>That's all for now. Catch us back at home next week for our final game of the season, against Columbia's 
fightin' Lionel Richies. Mmmmmmmmmmmbye!.</sp>

<sp><sd>Instead of roll-off into #1, script reader plays #1 on a kazoo while the Band marches off.</sd></sp>
