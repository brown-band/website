Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that dreads the inexorable march of time,

Brian Brown calls St. Louis his town<sbr/>
He's the greatest percussionist around<sbr/> 
He rarely wears sleeves<sbr/>
We'll cry when he leaves<sbr/>
We're so glad B. Brown is at Brown
</sp>
<sp>
Our Jenna's an ice skating queen<sbr/>
The best that we've ever seen<sbr/>
She says she's from Canada<sbr/>
But we say it's Jenneda<sbr/>
Life without her would be obscene
</sp>
<sp>
Our dear friend Margaret is so fun<sbr/>
She really loves a good pun<sbr/>
Also butts and booties<sbr/>
Not bats, but patooties<sbr/>
We'll be sad when her time here is done
</sp>
<sp>
With Zoe, where do we begin <sbr/>
She always marches us in <sbr/>
She enjoys conducting <sbr/>
bus singing, ghostbusting <sbr/>
Such a jam our time with her's been
</sp>
<sp>
We know a saxophonist named Liz<sbr/>
She hails from good ol' Texas (Texiz)<sbr/>
She gives Providence HOPE<sbr/>
And is generally dope<sbr/>
We know her we really will miss (mizz)
</sp>
<sp>
Of Matt Gasteiger we'd like to say<sbr/>
He's perfect in every way<sbr/>
Of the Blue Room he's king<sbr/>
With him, our hearts sing<sbr/>
Please don't leave, we want you to stay
</sp>
<sp>
Dear Emily once was our mom<sbr/>
She loved us and always was calm<sbr/>
Your boards were the best<sbr/>
Please don't leave the nest<sbr/>
'Cause life here with you is the bomb
</sp>
<sp>
Michaela's a fantastic musician<sbr/>
We know she has lots of ambition<sbr/>
She once was in Denmark<sbr/>
Her absence left its mark<sbr/>
Her kindness deserves recognition<sbr/>
</sp>
<sp>
All hail to our president Elaine<sbr/>
We're sorry we drive you insane<sbr/>
She crashes with nobility<sbr/>
Hashtag responsibility<sbr/>
Without you, we'll never be the same
</sp>
<sp>
We know of a great girl named Kristen<sbr/>
Who started her Brown days on Wriston<sbr/>
Her passion is psych<sbr/>
Brains, behavior, the like<sbr/>
Brunonia's halls she'll be missed in
</sp>
<sp>
Ryan is a really great guy<sbr/>
He's president of ADPhi<sbr/>
He's got drumming down pat<sbr/>
Bass drum's where it's at<sbr/>
His departure will cause us to sigh
</sp>
<sp>
Lia is the best that we've got<sbr/>
Flute in hand more often than not<sbr/>
She's a wonderful pal<sbr/>
She rocks the solo in Al<sbr/>
Without her, we'll be distraught
</sp>
<sp>
We know of this guy named Scott<sbr/>
We see him dancing a lot<sbr/>
He'll try to deny it<sbr/>
But we know it's a riot<sbr/>
And that kind of skill can't be taught
</sp>
<sp>
Our Derek we cannot replace<sbr/>
We'll never keep up with his pace<sbr/>
Please don't run away<sbr/>
We want you to stay<sbr/>
In our tackles we'll miss your embrace
</sp>
<sp>
We love our good friend Wenting<sbr/>
Such happiness does she bring<sbr/>
For her skills on the flute<sbr/>
We give her a salute<sbr/>
Wenting, to us, you mean everything
</sp>

<sp>
Seniors, we love you! But the fun's not over just yet - stay tuned for more cool jokes and hilarious tunes at halftime!

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that's ready to finish strong, 
it's the Brown University "going out with a bang... and a blow" BAAAAAAND!!!!!

With this game, the Band is wrapping up its fall season. It's been fun, but it's time for the Band to
 move on to something different. Here's a list of what the Band will do now that football season is over. </sp>
<sul>
<sli>A. Dry out and get warm for the first time in six weeks,</sli>
<sli>B. Go into a bear's natural winter state of hibernation,</sli>
<sli>C. Get married, have a few kids, buy some stuff, retire to Florida, and die,</sli>
<sli>D. Investigate this new sport played on ice with a tiny flat ball and sticks. Ice football?,</sli>
<sli>E. Invent a cure for peaking too early. We don't have one yet, but itâ€™s coming quickly, and</sli>
<sli>F. THE PRINCETON BAND!</sli>
</sul>
<sp> 
Watch now as the Band crawls into a cave to hibernate and plays "We Want Football Back".

Prior to this week's game, Columbia's team was sporting an 0-9 record. We're assuming they're not thrilled about this,
 but luckily we came up with a way they might be able to turn this perfect season around - switching the football players 
 for the Columbia Band members, of course! Columbia Bandies are well known for their ability to work as a team, mud 
 wrestle, and throw sixty-yard passes. Plus we're intrigued to see what would happen if we gave their football team 
 band instruments. Maybe they could work out their repressed feelings through banging and blowing instead of vigorous 
 hugging in tight pants. </sp>
 <sp>
 Watch now as the Band tosses around the pigskin and plays "Take on the Field".

A Columbia alumnus recently took to the New York Times to expound upon the controversial subject that's been on everyone's
 mind as of late: the brunch-industrial complex. Clearly he's putting that Ivy League education to good use. According to 
 him, "[Brunch is] about revelling in the naughtiness of waking up late, having cocktails at breakfast and eggs all day." If
 that's the naughtiest thing he can think of, he should spend more time with us. Cocktails for breakfast? How 'bout 
 cocktails for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and all the times in-between? It must be nice to have a life where the thing you 
 feel most strongly opposed to is people enjoying themselves, eating good food, and relaxing with their friends on the 
 weekend. Whatever they're teaching the kids over in New York to make them so bitter, we're glad we're not part of it. </sp>
<sp>
Watch now as the Band forms its final B of the season and plays "Grateful For Bruno and For Brown".

<sp>Thanks for sticking with us through the whole season. Join the Band at the men's hockey game on December 5 and keep your 
ears open for news of our ice skating shows next semester. Brown Band out!</sp>
