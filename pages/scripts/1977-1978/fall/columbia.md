Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you roarin’ Leo Tards! Presenting the only band worth its weight in brass, its height in balloon strings, and its Mass in Manning Chapel, it’s the Brown University, off Broadway, On Target, Off Color, EnTendre Band! :sd[enter screaming]

The Story: True. The Time: Now. The Place: NEW YORK. CITY OF STREETS, CORNERS, AND INTERSECTIONS. NEW YORK. Where any young man can grow up to buy a championship baseball team. And if he can’t do that, he can always buy the Yankees. NEW YORK. Where they’re tired of being poor, and the huddled masses are yearning to breathe. NEW YORK. with ladies faster than speeding bullets, and streetcorners named Desire. NEW YORK. Where we found the Forbidden Fruits of the Big Apple rolling about in the weeds, High on Morningside Heights. The classic warning comes to mind: COLOMBIAN: WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALL IT…DOPE.

The Band forms a smoking “J” and plays “Tijuana Tokes”

In addition to Columbia Students, there are plenty of other bizarre sects on the street corners of New York. The Hare Krishna strike you with their appearance. The muggers strike you with a baseball bat. The Municipal Workers strike. The members of the Salvation Army strike up the band. And the followers of Sun Myung Moon. (Cheeky little devils…)

Biblical scripture is paraded on the streets, pushed in subway stations, and even written on the bathrooms walls. Sc that we might study this scripture more closely, the Band stalls and plays “Gospel John.”

:sd[The Band forms a toilet bowl. At the end of the song, tire toilet flushes.]

Turning from Flushing to Manhattan, the Band takes a look at Hi-Rise Crime. Apartment buildings are no longer as safe as they used to be. You’re not even safe with a condominium. No matter how many locks you put on your door, you’re still not immune to New York’s most ingenious rip-off artist, Con Ed. With Con Ed, your money goes for service where the light never shines. But of course, if you den’t want to pay Con Ed’s prices, you can always take your business elsewhere. Right. Just like if you aren’t pleased with Ma Bell, you can always send smoke signals. Or scream. And we all know how effective screaming is in New York. One woman had to scream bloody murder for three days, before she got it.

Upset with all the violent crimes in New York, the Band does its part by forming a cleaver cn the field, symbolically castigating all violators and playing “Knife the Mack.”

:sd[The Band plays “Mack the Knife.”]

See us at Meehan in ten days, when the band trades in its one foot ball for a lot of good pucks.

:sd[March off to Ever True as crowd rises to give the Band a standing cvaticn for the great job they’ve done this year, and throw paper airplanes made from hundred dollar bills toward the Percussion Section.] :sd[The Percussion Section Who?]
