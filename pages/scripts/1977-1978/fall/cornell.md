Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Freshman Mothers and Fathers…and their parents: presenting the only Band in Providence banned in Providence, it’s the Brown University Band, in Providence.

Once a year, on Parent’s Weekend, thousands of tuition paying parents flock to the Campus to find out what Brown University is really like. On <u>Parent’s</u> Weekend. Don’t we put on a good show? These empty wine bottles in our rooms didn’t <u>always</u> have candles in them you know. And Mothers, just because your son’s bed isn’t made, doesn’t mean your son hasn’t made it all year. And just because your daughter is majoring in Spanish, doesn’t mean that she’s given up on her French. And just because your son doesn’t have a girlfriend, doesn’t mean that he hasn’t been <u>raised</u> properly.

Fondly celebrating our fine new-found Freshmen friends, the Band forms a bottle of Champagne, pops it’s cork on the field, and plays “Happy Days.”

:sd[Cork pops during song and flutes begin to flow out. Song and flow stop abruptly four bars before end.]

Although our “Happy Days” were prematurely interrupted by our parent’s coming, we know that as soon as they leave…

:sd[Flutes continue to flow. Band plays “Happy Days Are Here Again.”]

Of course, life at Brown isn’t just a bowl of cherries. If your son is the typical Freshman, he will also run up against some <u>hard</u> times. This year your son might:

:::script-list

- A) Drown while soaking up the perpetual Providence sunshine
- B) Starve to death eating at the Ratty;
- C) Wake up Tuesday morning for an A-hour class;
- D) Report to Health Services for a routinely fatal check-up;
- E) Go to a fraternity party, and find a really nice girl.

Be proud of your son, mothers, this could be the start of something big.

:sd[Band forms “’81” which changes to a smiling face. Play “This Could Be the Start of Something Big.”]

> If your love life is going real swell,\
> Cause you’ve found someone fun from Cornell\
> And you think that she’s so fine,\
> Be sure she’s not bovine,\
> The difference there’s real hard to tell.

:sd[March off to “Ever True.”]
