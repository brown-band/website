Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Ghosts of Crimson’s future: Presenting the only college band that does what we do… And we do it on skates, Meehan Rink’s answer to scotch on the rocks, it’s the Brown University Band, over ice.

:sd[Band starts to skate into formation.]

Although we realize it’s a little early to ring in the Christmas season, it’s also too late to be thre first ones to do so. Stores, banks, and the Hallmark card company have teen telling ycu for weeks that it’s just a few weeks away. But soon as we saw the Hospital Trust Building changing colors, we knew we had gotten into too many of the Holiday Spirits.

The Band rings in our Christmas season, playing “Libertine Bell.”

:sd[The Band forms a bell complete with moving knocker and clays the “Liberty Bell March.”]

As the winter recess approaches, the Band would like to offer an alternative Calendar Reform that we might just be able to slip past the faculty. Since we’d all like to have our first semester exams over by Christmas, why not just move Christmas to late January? After all, if we can move the Father of our Country’s birthday to make it more convenient, why can’t we move the Son of our Lord’s?

Wishing you a Merry Christmas from an entirely new direction, the Band forms God’s view of a pair of Christmas trees. With the presents hidden underneath, the Band reveals “The Best Things in Life Are Free.”

:sd[The Band forms two side-by-side circles with points in the middle \<get it?\> and plays “The Best Things in Life are Free.”]

Come with us tomorrow afternoon as the Band does to carolling what Carol’s been doing all year.

:sd[Counter skate off to Ever True.]
