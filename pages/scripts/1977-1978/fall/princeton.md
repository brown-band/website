Ladies and gentlemen! Friends and alumni! And all you fast fading formerly frivouls and philandering, forever frenetically floundering Freshmen, Freshwomen, and Transfers! :sd[Deep breath] We take pride in presenting the Freshmen and Transfer Weak Committee Band.

:sd[Band meanders onto field lost, with maps and either T or F on their sweaters.]

You’ve already been coddled, pampered, fondled, caressed, and otherwise shown the ins and outs of Brown University, and now that your first tuition check has cleared and it’s too late to leave, the Band now deems it appropriate to pontificate upon heretofore undivulged Bear Facts. We’ll begin the Brown Band Guide to Camp Bruno with a look at student government.

:sd[Band forms UCS with only half of the S formed]

Forgive our half-s formation, but we <u>are</u> representing the UCS, and they have troubles with attendance. Imagine an organization that tried to impeach an elected official last year for faulty attendance, but not enough people showed up at the meeting. Proving once again that truth is stranger than Princeton.

The Band plays “Pennies From Heaven and Dollars for Votes.”

Turning our stomachs to the Ratty, where something is always coming up, the Band asks you to try and guess what the surprize was in last night’s tomato surprise. Was it:

:::script-list

- A) Buffalo Chip Cookies?
- B) German Shepherd’s Pie?
- C) Hasn’t come back from the lab yet
- D) Turkey Tetrachloride? or speaking of turkeys,
- F) Princeton Band

:::

The Band forms the line to the Ratty restroom and plays “Up, Up and Away.”

Coming out of the Ratty, the Band goes to the John :sd[short pause] D. Rockfeller Library. Freshmen must by now know that many of the books at the Rock are on three hour reserve, but you may not be aware that many of the librarians are on a similar working arrangement. One of them is outstanding, and now overdue. The Band forms a syringe of caffeine and salutes the pre-Meds who stay at the Rock, around the clock.

In another vein, come again in two weeks, but don’t tell your parents.

:sd[Band marches off to Brown Man Born as crowd strangles.]
