Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you holy Cross-Eyed Crusaders, presenting the only band that has ever come here out of Divine Providence, it’s the Brown University Altered Boys Band!

Having sat in on a few Holy Cross classes, the Band found itself thinking about religious oppression. High on the list of our favorite oppressions is that golden oldie, the Spanish Inquisition. The Spanish Inquisitors, as we all know, were <u>rigidly</u> opposed to anyone having more fun than they were having. Persecution was rampant, and possessions were redistributed. The nuns got more, the Moors got less, 2nd the Jews got none. Those who loved Buttah were forced to eat margarine. And those who ate meat on Fridays were burned at their steaks. Since we’re too religious to eat anything but Mrs. Pope Paul’s Fish Sticks, the Band forms a burning steak and plays “Light My Fire.”

But of course, the Catholics, too, had their share of oppression. In ancient Rome, persecution took a different forum. Life for the lions wasn’t so bad though. Their day started off with a roarin’ god breakfast of eggs, Juiwse, milk-toast, and a super bowl of Crispy Christians. They’re G-R-R-R-EAT!!

The critics raved during the last coleseum performance. the Daily Trojan said, “C’mon, now, Caesar!” The Roman Candle said, “Pardon me, Goy, is that the cat who chewed a new Jew?” And the Christian Science Monitor was too late to remark: “Hold that Lion!”

:sd[Band spells “LION” and plays “Hold that Tiger.”]

Turning from Roman Catholics to Wanderin’ Jews, the Band, after 3000 years has finally found the Lost Tribes of Israel. :sd[BAND: “How lost are they?”] They are so lost that they must be the Holy Cross Faculty. They have degenerated into a completely unrecognizable state (Massachusetts), and can only be recognized by

The Band throws it’s own two cents in, and prays with “Pennies for Heaven.”

Be back in two years, when the Band asks the musical question: “Will Reverend Moon?”
