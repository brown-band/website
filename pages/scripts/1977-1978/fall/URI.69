And we paid a dollar to see that? Get those walking carpets off the field! Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, droids, sandpeople, Ramettes, and
other Space Cadets! Presenting the only band that can travel through hyperspace as well as it dusts crops, it's the Brown University Skywalker Band!

A long time ago, in a grocery far, far away... a rebel shopping cart, returning from a clandestine shoplifting mission, is apprehended carrying Princess
Leia Organic. The Princess' life is in grave danger, as she intercepted an imperial transmission specifying the secret construction plans for a STAR MARKET.

Princess Leia has hidden the plans for the death store inside her little robot companion Tutti-frutti. Tutti-frutti and the other robot, C-Spaghettio are
jettisoned into aisle space to keep the plans from the evil dark lord, Ralph Nader, and deliver them to General Obi-Won Baloney. The band forms the
deadly store and plays "By the Light of the Silvery Moon".

Turning from spheres to Lampheres, the band salutes Brown women who have gotten ahead. The band whole-heartedly agrees that a women should be hired for every
man on campus. Other actions pending against Brown include those of the O.S.A., the Organization of Stupid People, in Blackstone Valley, who site
the alarming statistic that as many as half of all people have below average intelligence. Furthermore, that half of these fall below the 25th percentile.
And so on. These people feel that Brown admissions should not be discriminating on the basis of intelligence. Brilliant piece of brainwork, huh? That's
no brain, that's a space station. The band forms a rotting brain and plays "Braindrops Keep Falling From my Head".

Be back for free next week, when the Princeton Band will really give you your money's worth.
