## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you fire hydrant fertilizers! Presenting, for the first time anywhere since last year, the worst, the sloppiest, the ugliest, the most imprecise bumbling, tone-deaf, spasticated, flat-chested, Havard rejects ever to come into the Yale Bowl! But first, the Brown University Marching Band.

:sd[Band enters screaming]

While former President Brewster is taking his junior year abroad, and the Kingman is consorting with the Queen woman, Yale is, like a puppy who has lost it's master, left to perpetually scratch at the proverbial screen door of life. The band joins Yale in thanking Mr. Brewster for his fourteen years of service by playing "Merci, Merci, Merci" and forming "Tanks" on the field.

Having gone through the painful process of selecting a new president ourselves, we've decided to give Yale a helping hand. No, we're not giving you President Swearer, 'cause we kinda like Uncle Howie. But we have prepared a list of worthwhile candidates to consider. First of all we suggest Derek Bok, so all the Yalies can pretend they're at Havard. Or, if that won't work. How about Farrah Fawcett, so they won't really mind those four years at Yale. And if these don't meet your approval. There's always Bert Lance, 'cause he'll be out of a job soon anyway.

But after careful consideration, we fell that your best choice would be someone from your own ranks whom all the Yalies can relate to, and many often do, the Yale Bulldog. And with the Bulldog on campus fulltime, you won't have to ask why "Everything is Going Up Roses"

Turning from elections to irreconcilable differences, the band salutes that walking hurricane, Anita. By the way, Anita, it's ten o'clock. Do you know who's your Sun kist? The band reminds you of the famous words of the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz who said "Of course, some people do go both ways". And we form Anita Bryant on the field.
