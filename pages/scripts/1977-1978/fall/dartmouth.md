Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you well-fertilized Greens! Presenting, straight from a three-week self-defense course at the A.S.P.C.Us, the only Band that’s ever escaped from Hanover with their instruments intact, it’s the Brown University Don’t Take Us For Granite Band!

:sd[Enter screaming.]

The Brown Band has always had one problem in Hanover. Dartmouth. It seems that Dartmouth fans get an unhealthy amount of subliminal pleasure out of beating us up. C’mon now guys, that’s just not funny! There are better ways to vent your pent-up frustration. You could:

:::script-list

- A) jog three laps around the Dartmouth Homecoming Queen, (Whoever he is)
- B) try to remember your name three times fast;
- C) do some push-ups. It’ll go away;
- D) chase some Dartmouth Snow-bunnies.
- E) catch some Dartmouth Snow-bunnies;
- or F) The Princeton Band.

:::

Anticipating that you haven’t learned a thing from our pacifistic appeal to your intelligence, the Band takes a long look into its short future and plays “Scars and Scrapes Forever.”

:sd[Band spells “DON’T” which changes to “STOP” and plays “Stars and Stripes Forever.” The Dartmouth Freshmen empty onto the field, attack Lisa “Pyro-maniac” Depier, and scare the shit out of us.]

But we can understand why all the guys at Dartmouth have to take out their frustrations. After all, there’s nothing else at Dartmouth to take out. Except a pizza. And what can you do with a Pepperoni? That hasn’t already been done. Contrary to popular belief, there are plenty of Dartmouth women to go around. It’s just that you can’t tell them from Dartmouth men. And that’s not the women’s fault at all. It’s no wonder that the ration of men to women was listed in the Freshman Handbook as either 25, or 6, to 4.

:sd[Band forms a hermaphrodite sex symbol and plays “25 or 6 to 4.”]

Turning from Green Gangs to Gangreens, the Band takes a classic look inside itself, and considers the Ilium and the artery, along with other healthy parts of a Homer-sapien. But according to current AMA policy, just because its healthy, that’s no reason not to remove it. The Band cut-ups form a scalpel, perform our third clarinectomy, and close with “Another Opening, Another Sew.”

:sd[The Band forms a scalpel and the third clarinets form themselves. During the song, the scalpel moves through the clarinets, splitting them apart, as the Band plays “Another Opening, Another Show.”]

Be back in two years, as our glockenspiel player finds once again that Dartmouth weather can freeze your bells off.

:sd[March of to “ever True,” as crowd begins to throw blunt instruments of destruction upon our innocent little heads. Why don’t they leave us alone, Mommy?]
