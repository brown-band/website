Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you little Red Rotten Hoods, presenting, straight from a 3 week engagement in Las Vegas, and a quickie divorce in Reno, the only band any alumnus would be proud to take home to Mother (while Father’s out of town), it’s the Brown University Pre-alumni Band, with no strings attached.

:sd[Band runs onto field with helium balloons.]

Welcome back, Alumni. We’re sure that you thank the University for having ycu here this weekend. And all the hotels from here to Seekonk thank your for coming here, and the Police in your hometowns have never been more pleased.

Many of you younger alumni are already beginning to feel nostalgic, when you come back and visit your freshman room. But you don’t know what nostalgia is, till you return to find your freshman dorm renamed after your freshman roommate. And nostalgia takes on a new meaning for alumni fathers when they find their son living in the same Pembroke room that they spent so much time in. And who knows what interesting surprises are in store for us when we return, when we’re sixty-four.

:sd[Band forms “64” on the field and plays “When I’m Sixty-four.” During the song, the rest of the and forms “17” so that formation reads “1764.”]

> The name of Harvard! renowned,\
> But Harvard Alumni have found,\
> That their greatest reward,\
> Is struggling toward,\
> Sending their children to Brown.

In honor of Brown Alumni from 1764 to even last year, watch now as the Band does the impossible, as usual. With Buddy Cianci dotting the “i!”

:sd[Band marches into “Brown” in script while playing “BBB” and “Brown Forevermore.”]

Please rise now and join the Band as we play the Brown University Alma Mater.

:sd[Play “The Old Oaken Bucket.” Release balloons.]

Be back in two weeks when the Band will do to its Seniors what the censor has been doing to the Band Shows all year.

:sd[March off to “Ever True.”]

The Band would like to thank the Associated Alumni for supplying us with the world’s largest group of playable balloons east of the Mississippi, and special thanks to our friend Fenton for getting this thing off the ground.
