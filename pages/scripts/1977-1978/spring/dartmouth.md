Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you semi-tough, semi-intelligent, semi-tight, semi-Ivy League Dartmouth semi-literates, presenting — direct from appearances on the <u>Today Show</u>, the <u>NBC News</u>, <u>WJAR Newscam 10</u>, the <u>Providence-Journal Bulletin</u>, <u>AND</u> the grand ballroom of the Holiday Inn — it’s those debutantes of the snow balls, the Brown University semi-formal, semi-skating, coming-out Band.

The Band invites you to look back at your senior ball and prom night, where some tripped the light fantastic and some just tripped, where some sipped champagne and some slipped in pain, where some stayed out all night and some got to bed early. The Band forms a clock, moves its hands in a circular motion, and plays “Rock Around the Clock.”

Turning from raising the rafters to natural disasters, the Band looks at the Dartmouth hockey team — no, not <u>un</u>natural disasters, but that great thrust of Mother Nature, the blizzard of ’78 which all but brought Providence to a grinding halt by pelting it with 30 inches overnight.

In just a few short hours, the nation’s smallest state was transformed into the nation’s largest parking lot. But we can’t complain — somehow being snowbound at Brown is like not being snowbound at all — we kept each other warm and cozy. Follow the bouncing snowflake as the Band brings you its rendition of “Light My Fire.”

Be with us in 29 weeks when the Brown Band makes its triumphant re-entry from the bushes through the goalposts into Brown Stadium.
