Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you rested and relaxed returning rambunctious rink rooters, Presenting: Meehan’s most monotonously melodious macho morons meticulously mangling Mozart’s marvelous melodies, and making much more mature music than most mere mortal matriculators could possibly want to hear. It’s the world’s only and 17th best skating band, the Brown University World War II Precision Skating Drill Team!

:sd[skate into: cross, play: “Hogan’s Heroes.” At the end the song, an accident will occur. “Ambulance” consisting of stretcher, flashing lights, flame baton, and sax siren states onto ice, removes victim, skates off to thunderous applause. Then the Band in stands plays “Wide World cf Sports.”]

This is Brown Band Wide World of War—skating the ice to bring a constant variety of atrocities: The thrill of sex, the agony of sex, and the joy of sex. Today’s program will NOT take us to see the following disasters:

> To Providence—to observe sophisticated snow removal techniques.\
> To Hartford—to see Meehan’s sister dome doing its impersonation of the Roman open-air Coliseum.\
> To Philadelphia—to see the Ivy League’s mistake.\
> To 195 Angell Street—to see the editors of the BDH practice their fire-drill techniques. And finally,\
> To Warsaw—to watch Jimmy Carter become the world’s newest Polish joke.

Turning from lust to thrust, Wide World of War locks at ballistic missles as a possible solution to the Irish Civil Mar by spreading the North and South Irish apart, right in the border.

:sd[The Band forms an island and a missle and plays “Up, Up, and Away.” During the song the missle penetrates the island which splits in two.]

And remember, when the Brown Band plays war games, the winners are the ones who get bombed and the losers keep their borders intact.

:sd[Skate off to “Ever True”]
