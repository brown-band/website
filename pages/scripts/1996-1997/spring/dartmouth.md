Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and a warm welcome to any and all wealthy patrons of the arts in attendance this evening, presenting an organization representing the pinnacle of artistic integrity -- yes, we DARE call it art -- it’s the Brown University Multimedia Installation on Ice!

:sd[Band slides into the groove]

The Brown Band has decided to change its image. Think of us no longer as bandies, but as serious artists, combining elements of ice dancing, guerrilla performance art, and street performance, in what is not merely a skating show at a hockey rink but, more, a Multimedia Experience. You’ll see the band skate to poorly written poetry, perform mellifluous feats of melody, and even the wonder that is Vartan on Ice! Unfortunately, our new uniforms haven’t arrived yet, so for the time being you’ll just have to imagine us doing all this in black turtlenecks and berets.

OK, I’ll level with you... we lied about Vartan on Ice. But here’s the next best thing!

And now for the poetry.

This abstract little gem was written by a collective poetry group working out of the basement of a Parisian marble factory. Unfortunately for American art-lovers, much of their work has been denied import by the US Food and Drug Administration as a health hazard. They did, however, manage to smuggle us this one baked into a loaf of French bread. We hope you find it as hard to swallow as we did.

Pickled Chicken Knuckles

Passive Aggressive Paranoid Schizophrenic\
One of Freud’s favorite woids\
You joik.\
Dis’ll nevah woik. . .

Because the Cabbage Patch Doll will eat your hair\
And devour your soul\
And haunt\
Your deepest dreams

‘Klaatu Barata Nikto’ means:\
Nuke it from orbit, just to be safe.

Thank you!

Please watch now as the Brown Ice Troupe performs an interpretive dance.

:sd[Band does just that while playing "Johnny’s Mambo"]

Behold as it behooves the band to become bristly like great Gregorian’s goatee. And while we’re on the matter of woolly matter (a weighty matter indeed), we thought it ought to be enlightening for some of the Dartmouth fans in the audience to point out that Scottish scientists recently succeeded in cloning--

Oh, never mind. It’s just too easy.

Watch now as the band performs its salute to popular culture as simultaneous expression and subversion of the capitalist mass marketplace by forming a roll-on.

Killer Emus couldn’t drag us away, but our press agent says we should keep it short and sweet. You know, leave you wanting more. Besides, we have to grease the wheels by buying the local art critic dinner at Paragon. In any case, we’ll see you all next season!
