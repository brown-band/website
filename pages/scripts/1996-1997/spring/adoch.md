Ladies and gentlemen :sd[beat] and prefrosh, presenting another organization that always eats its applesauce, it’s the Brown University Heaven’s Gatecrashers BAND!

:sd[Band rushes stage]

CONGRATULATIONS! Whatever you do, don’t throw this envelope away. You may already have won a no-expense paid trip to a higher plane of existence. . . No, it’s not the Hale-Bopp Comet, it’s a prestigious Ivy League University! That’s right, all you have to do is return the enclosed forms. . . take several dozen standardized tests. . . endure a nerve wracking personal interview. . . have flawlessly perfect grades AND if we don’t decide that we just don’t like the look of your face WE’LL SAY:

“JOE STUDENT HAS JUST barely SURVIVED THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS PROCESS!”

Thaaaaaat’s right! You may have already won a spiff new college education-- It slices! It dices! Just look at all those julienned brain cells! It even makes a decent wall decoration, and if you’re really lucky it MIGHT JUST get you a job!

:sd[Band plays “Joshua”]

Your own diploma! Don’t miss this opportunity. Not sold in any stores... how much would you expect to pay for this little wonder? 3 million dollars? 4 million dollars? More? Order now and it’s yours for the low, low Ivy League price of 29 thousand nine-hundred ninety-nine, ninety-nine per year!

But wait! If you act now you’ll also receive at some extra charge student activities! That’s right! All the protests on the main green your social conscience desires! Clubs for anything you could imagine, no matter how obscure! A corporate sellout so-called college radio station! Dogmatic socialists preaching sermons! Ivy League caliber college athletics PLUS a world class scatter band! It’s a football band! It’s a hockey band! Even plays for weddings, bar mitzvahs and birthday parties. Three! Three! Three bands in one!

:sd[Band plays #3]

Alright, pop quiz hotshot! If you fail to answer any of these questions, you will be chained to a chair and forced to watch SPEED 2 until you chew your own leg off or suffer braindeath, whichever comes first.

1. As a high school senior. . . what have you done so far that has had a significant effect on the course of world history?
2. So, what exactly IS that stuck between your teeth?
3. If you were a Smurf, which Smurf would you be, and why?
4. In the space provided, please explicate Alanis Morisette’s metaphysic of the ironic.
5. Yes, and what makes you think YOU’RE good enough to go attend MY university?
6. What do you want out of life?

:::script-list

- a) I want answers... NOW!
- b) I wanna join the Brown Band and be a bandie and play music and go on cool road trips and make fun of Dartmouth students because they have nothing better to do than get drunk and dress up livestock in their sister’s lingerie.
- c) :sd[beat] Wait, what was the question again?
- d) I’m going to go to college, then go to grad school, then become a professor so I can stay in school forever. I’m never going to have to face the real world! Never! EVER!
- e) [cosmic hippie voice] The ultimate hamburger. Or the ultimate wave. Or the ultimate orgasm. Or maybe I’ll just be an MTV VJ. or
- f) The Princeton Band

Watch now as the band thinks about all the things it learned in high school.

:sd[Band plays “Kodachrome”]

Well, it seems as if you’ve all survived your ordeal. The envelopes arrived and by golly they were big suckers. You’ve now reached that point in your life when you stop trying to impress colleges and THEY start trying to impress YOU. And you gotta admit it’s pretty impressive the way those tourguides can walk backwards like that.

(Don’t be fooled. Read the fine print-- the ability to walk backwards is actually a requirement for graduation.)

But no worries for now, just sit back and relax. Enjoy the a capella frenzy that is to come. And remember, you won’t ever have to go through this again.

At least. . . not until a few years in the future when it’s time to apply for summer internships.

:sd[Band plays “Time Warp”]

Join us again tomorrow at noon at Faunce Arch to see the Brown Band perform its world infamous impersonation of the Pied Piper. You can’t miss us-- we’ll be the ones with the shiny instruments playing the loud music.

:sd[Band Marches off to #1]
