## Pregame:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, freshman mothers and fathers (and their parents), presenting an organization that just cleaned its room for the first time this year, it’s the Brown University "You got what pierced?!" Band!

:sd[Band enters field, forms football, plays (what else?) "NFL Today"]

Possibly the greatest writer of our time, the infinitely gifted Michael Crichton, is currently working on a sequel to his cinematic masterpiece Twister. Word on the street is that it’s going to be called Quaker. Everybody Polka! Watch now as the Brown University Biergarden Band does an Oedipus maneuver and attempts to polka your eyes out.

:sd[Band forms "B", plays "Brown Bear"]

:sd[Band marches off to #1]

## Halftime:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, freshman mothers and fathers (and their parents), presenting an organization that doesn’t wear anything under its kilt, but boy does that wool itch, it’s the Brown University "I am Elrod T. Snidley of the clan Snidley" Band!

:sd[Nothing happens]

Uh... Band?

:sd[Entire band yells "There can be only one!" and runs onto field]

With the prospect of election day looming ever closer, the Brown Band is proud to announce that we’ve discovered a viable alternative: The Mascot Party. Their slate of candidates includes newly unemployed Olympics mascot Whatizzy for president and the Brown Band’s own faithful mascot Elrod T. Snidley for veep. Snidley is returning to politics after several years’ absense following his narrow defeat in the election for Brown Student Council President.

Izzy and Snidley have been running on a platform of equal rights for mascots. If you have any problems with this concept, please discuss them with the bear. Watch now as the band forms a ballot with a write-in vote and plays "Izzy’s Mambo."

:sd[Band forms ballot, plays "Johnny’s Mambo"]

Hold onto your haggis ladies and gentlemen, at this time the Brown University Band is pleased to welcome the Rhode Island Highlanders!

:sd[Band forms arch, highlanders march in playing "Scotland the Brave." Band joins them the second time through]

:sd[Highlanders play "Amazing Grace" three times through, band joins in second and third times]

Join us next week in Meehan Auditorium for the Men’s Hockey season opener against Harvard, then again in two weeks time when Brown Football follows them to their unspeakable lair in Cambridge.

:sd[Highlanders march off playing #1... Band follows them off also playing #1]

Join us next week when the Bears pummel Penn and the band welcomes the Rhode Island Highlanders. There'll be bagpipes aplenty!

:sd[Band plays #1, marches off field]
