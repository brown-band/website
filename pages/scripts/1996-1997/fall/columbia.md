## Pregame:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that promises no smurf jokes or triple your money back, it’s the Brown University "Three apples high" BAND!

:sd[Band runs onto field, forms football]

:sd[Band plays "NFL Today"]

Today’s game, which has historically been played to see who would avoid residing in the basement of the Ivy League, is instead a battle for second place. Watch now as the Brown Band salutes an amazing season of Brown football by playing "For Bruno and For Brown."

:sd[Band forms "B," plays #4]

:sd[Band Marches off to #1 (still in "B")]

## Halftime:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, presenting an organization that has been banned from BioSphere 2, it’s the Brown University "Which virus was in the vial I just dropped?" BAND!

:sd[Band infects field]

Mapping the discursive play of cultural dialogues onto Foucault’s panopticon model in a postmodern world where public areas have achieved the status of hyperreality and marginalized identities risk assimilation into the simulacrum formed by an Althuserrian dominant ideology, we can agree with Eve Sedgwick that drag can be seen as a deconstruction of gender’s performativity as a culturally constructed...

Uh, Bob?

:sd[Bob Chapman ‘98 stops running, looks up at press box]

I have bad news for you. . . I think you must have given the Columbia script to your semiotics professor.

:sd[Chapman smacks his forehead in dismay]

What do you want me to do?

:sd[Chapman shrugs]

OK, I’ll wing it. Watch now as the band, um. . . as the band... gets a head start on Thanksgiving by forming a turkey baster and playing "Birdland."

:sd[Band forms baster and plays "Birdland"]

OK, I know... We’ll do a salute to Mother Goose:

Boutros Boutros sat on the wall\
Boutros Boutros had a great fall\
Cos all of our diplomats and those kinds of men\
Don’t want old Boutros to run the UN

Old Bob Dole\
Was a sour old soul\
And a sour old man was he\
He called for a tax cut\
Talked up family values\
But still couldn’t find victory

Sing a song of Clinton, let’s make him a big cake\
Four and twenty Grad Students set out for to bake\
When the bake was finished one Grad said to the rest\
"Hope this cake is really good ‘cause I just missed my test!"

Watch now as the Brown Band disses the butcher and the candlestick maker and salutes the baker, and the voters of California, by forming a cake and playing "Brown Man Baked."

:sd[Band forms cake and plays "Brown Man Born"]

Baa baa green sheep\
Have you any band?\
Yes sir, yes sir\
They play Hawaii 5-0 on demand

Boris, Boris, with liver porous,\
How does your country run?\
"With vodka glasses and heart bypasses\
And KGB files on everyone."

Hickory dickory dock\
The band was watching the clock\
So if our show runs overtime\
You all can...

Watch now as the Brown Band forms what’s left of Boris Yeltsin’s liver and tries to turn back time.

:sd[Band forms "B" and plays "Timewarp"]

And now ladies and gentlemen, sit tight for the next component of the half-time festivities: No, they’re not refugees from the East Side, they’re a group of the only musicians on Earth more confused than Michael Jackson... as for the Brown Band, we’ll see you all next season!

:sd[Band marches off to #1 on yard lines]
