## Pregame:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, presenting an organization that promises no sheep jokes or triple your money back, it’s the Brown University Shear Madness Band!

:sd[Band is herded onto field, forms football and plays "NFL Today"]

:sd[Band forms champagne glass, as bandies are mentioned band plays "Bits ‘n’ Pieces" and bandies run to the top as "bubbles"]

As this is the last home game of the season, we would like to take this chance to honor the senior members of the Brown Band who are here with us for their last time today.

First there’s Kathleen Attfield. She’s from West Virginia, but we love her anyway. Just be glad that we’re playing for more than five people.

Next we have Mike Radwin. You’ll just have to trust me when I say he looks better in a skirt. If he can’t get a job at MicroSoft, Mike looks forward to employment as the next posterboy for Zima.

Finally we have Arik Zwirner... finally because his name is the last on any conceivable alphabetical list. Just remember folks, [a la Arnold Schwarzenneger in "Kindergarten Cop"] It’s NOT a tuba!

And so we bid them good luck in whatever they may attempt. May the wind always be at their backs, or at least keep them well downwind. All joking aside, they serve as reminders of what will happen to to the rest of us when we too accumulate thirty credits. Maybe suddenly Grad School isn’t looking like such a bad idea after all.

## Halftime:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, presenting an organization that changes platforms every four years, it’s the Brown University "Memento Moratorium" BAND!

:sd[Band integrates field]

After considering numerous possibilities for this week’s show, including musical salutes to topics including, but not limited to, free range carrots, various inflatable objects, vegan stew (mmm, vegans), comedian Jeff Foxworthy’s incredibly lame brand of redneck humor, and 101 things to do with a great big hole in the ground, the Brown Band finally settled on a salute to all things geeky.

What’s that you say? A salute to Dartmouth? No, no, a salute to all things geeky, not Greeky!

We’ll start off with physics, because the band has a lot in common with light. You see, sometimes we behave like a particle [Band squeezes together in middle of field] and sometimes like a wave [Band does the wave]. Watch now as the band salutes physics and scientific experimentation in general by reenacting the two slit experiment all day and all of the night.

:sd[Band demonstrates paradoxical quantum behavior of photons shot through two slits in a carboard barrier and plays "All Day and All of the Night."]

Because of our interest in all things geeky, the band was very interested to hear that Dartmouth College has finally set a release date for the long delayed BASIC ‘96. It’s designers promise that BASIC ‘96 is destined to change the way first graders and Dartmouth students use computers, although detractors say that it’s nothing more than LOGO ‘89. As for the computing needs of the Brown Band, we prefer Unix.

What’s that you say? Doesn’t that hurt? No, no... not those kind of eunuchs, Unix the operating system!

:sd[Band forms "X^2" (x squared) on field]

Humor has always been an integral part of the Brown Band, but it has come to our attention that some people accuse us of being derivative. Watch now as we differentiate ourselves.

:sd[Band forms "2X," plays "In The Fray"]

Of course no salute to all things geeky would be complete without reference to Star Trek. In less than a week the boys at Paramount will release a new Trek film on the unsuspecting masses. Trekkies, Trekkers and Tribbles everywhere wait with baited breath to see what happens when the crew travels back in time in order to prevent Boris Yeltsin from getting back on the sauce. Will Worf be able to take down Janet Reno in single combat? Can Data show more emotion than Al Gore? Who are more ruthless, the Borg or the Republican Congress? And of course the ultimate question on everybody’s mind: [dramatic pause] Can Captain Kirk continue to pick up women from beyond the grave?

Watch now as we boldly go where no Band has gone before.

:sd[Band forms "B" plays "Time Warp"]

Join us next week when the Bears take on the Lions of Columbia and the Brown Band shakes off these little town blues.

:sd[Band plays #1, marches off field]
