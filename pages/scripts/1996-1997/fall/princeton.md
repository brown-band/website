## Pregame:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, presenting an organization that traveled South in search of the New World and found New Jersey instead, it's the Brown University "Garden, what garden?" Band!

:sd[Band discovers field, forms football, plays "NFL Today"]

No less an authority than one-time resident Albert Einstein once called Princeton "A quaint ceremonious village of puny demigods on stilts." Watch now as the Brown University Relativistic Band salutes puny demigods everywhere by forming a pair of stilts and playing the Brown Apotheosis Song.

:sd[Band forms pair of stilts and plays #2]

And now for the single non-rotating "B." Deal with it.

:sd[Band forms "B," plays "Brunonia as we go Marching"]

## Halftime:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae:

Tyger tyger glowing soft\
With your whiskers held aloft\
What incompetent tooth or knee\
Left you stuck in New Jersey?

And on whose economic advice\
Did Tony slash his cereal's price?\
Eenie meenie miney moe\
Catch a tyger by the toe.

In what distant turnpike skies\
Burns the residue of McDonald's fries?\
What gas company do we have to thank\
For putting a tyger in our tank?

That William Blake what a nutty guy\
Who else would try to rhyme symmetry with eye?\
Maybe it was his immortal hand\
that framed the BROWN UNIVERSITY BAND!

:sd[Band pounces onto field]

The Brown Band can't even begin to express its pleasure to be performing at the College of New Jersey, especially as a show of solidarity against our fellow Ivy Leaguers who are selfishly trying to rob you of your name. It is truly absurd to think that anybody would ever confuse Princeton and the College of New Jersey. In fact, anybody who made that kind of mistake would have to be a complete and utter. . . What? Oh. . . never mind!

Watch now as the band forms New Jersey and plays "Time Warp" to give me time to think up some Princeton jokes.

As the OJ Simpson case finds a ghoulish new life in civil court, the band can't help but be reminded of such ghoulish, parasitic creatures as vampires, zombies, Kato Caelin, and deans in charge of housing. Upon viewing the architecture at Princeton, we can hardly imagine a location more suited for any of the above mentioned creatures. We can only imagine, however, that a vampire at Princeton would demand that his victim had a martini before he drank their blood.

Watch now as the Brown University Anemic Band does its salute to bloodsuckers everywhere by forming a straw and playing the "In The Neck."

Guess what kids? SAT time is coming up! In honor of Princeton, home of ETS, we would like to present a standardized test refresher course:

Ludicrous Lubricant and Celibate Syllabus are examples of:

:::script-list

- a) sybaritic sibilance
- b) alarming alliteration
- c) onomatopoeia
- d) rutabagas
- e) bicenquinquagennial\
- or,
- f) The Princeton Band

:::

Watch now as the band forms the correct answer and salutes the SATs, as the scores go plummeting down.

Join us next week when the Brown Bears play Fordham at home and the Brown Band goes pigeon hunting.
