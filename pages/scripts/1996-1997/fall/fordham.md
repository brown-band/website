## Pregame:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, and kids, presenting an organization that’s putting its money on Barney in the upcoming battle of the PBS stars because a dinosaur can beat any bird, no matter how big it is, it’s the Brown University "C" is for cookie, that’s good enough for me Band!

## Halftime:

<small>(or, The Band Sells Out)</small>

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, Dean Shaw’s family, and all the Shaw’s Family Day families, presenting an organization with absolutely no street cred, it’s the Brown University Sellout Band!

Last season, if you recall, the Brown Band, out of a heartfelt love for the product, did a halftime show salute to Nantucket Nectars, which led Tom & Tom to supply us with a years supply of their fine drink. Since then, many other companies have approached us offering enormous sums for endorsements. Of course we refused. While some people get their Kix making money, we take no Joy in the rising Tide of crass commercialism and hope that it has already reached its Zenith. We prefer to Bounce back, remain Spic’N’Span, even though the Bounty offered is often quite Brawny. We hope you will all Cheer us on in our effort to remain true to our art.

Speaking of our art, watch now as the band forms a PEZ dispenser and salutes disco.

OK, you found us out. It was actually the Brown Band disguised as Roberto Alomar who hocked a loogie on that umpire. It really was the Brown Band who tripped Bob Dole on his way to the podium. It was in fact the Brown Band who stole the world’s largest ball of lint from the Smithsonian. It was really the Brown Band who suspended a first-grader for sexual harassment. It was indeed the Brown Band with Sandy Duncan in that commercial for Spam-flavored Wheat Thins. The Brown Band does sit too close to the television. The Brown Band even replaced the T-shirts being launched into the crowd with its own dirty laundry. In fact, the Brown Band followed in Dave Letterman’s footsteps by marketing its own Brown Band Brand Canned Ham. It’s priced low enough so that you can buy it even if you ordinarily can’t afford ham.

Watch now as the Brown Band brings home the bacon and plays "Bring the Profit"

At this point we were considering a joke about the presidential election. Then we realized something. The elction isn’t funny. It’s not exciting. It’s really just plain depressing. Rather than considering a choice between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton, we will concentrate on more uplifting things, like the inevitable heat death of the universe, jagged little twit Alannis Morisette’s ascent to the top of the pop charts, and the Russian astronauts indefinately stranded on the space station Mir because Russia can’t afford to get them down. Isn’t that better. If that fails you can just be glad the Brown Band isn’t an a capella group.
