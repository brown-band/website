## Pregame

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, presenting an organization that can dance the Macarena better than Al Gore, it’s the Brown University “hey watch it, that was my foot!” Band!

:sd[Band (light on its feet) enters from sideline, forms football]

:sd[Band plays “NFL Today”]

And now the band will do its impression of a Bulldog drinking out of the Yale Bowl.

:sd[Band forms “Y,” plays “Bulldogs, Bulldogs”. . . bottom of “Y” splits off and forms an “o” next to it, spelling “Yo”]

Welcome to another exciting year of Brown football!

## Halftime

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumnae, presenting the only organization that quotes Kierkegaard more often than President Gregorian, it’s the Brown University “sound of one hand clapping” Band!

Recently the band has been pondering the meaning of life. We are sure we are not alone in this however, as the Yale Band probably wonders whether their lives have any meaning every day. Nonetheless we have set out on a search for the answers to life’s imponderables, like:

- Why are we here?
- What is the nature of reality?
- What in the world was the staff of US News and World Report smoking?\
  and
- What is the Ratty cheese sauce really made of?

First we sought for answers at the traveling Smithsonian exhibit which has stopped in Providence. Unfortunately, there is a long list of things we didn’t find there. Here are some of them:

- Lounge space in First-year dorms
- Bob Dole’s chances of getting elected
- Providence Mayor “Buddy” Cianci’s ashtray
- Ross Perot’s chances of being noticed
- The meaning of life\
  and
- Yale mascot Handsome Dan XIV

Watch now as the band forms the dialectic play of thesis and antithesis and plays “Hegel’s Mambo.”

Next we tried to find meaning in so-called extreme sports. Unfortunately we learned that next year’s Extreme Games will be taking place in New Haven. While the Extreme Games in Providence included such events as street luge and synchronized bungee-jumping, the New Haven Extreme Games will have bullet dodging, getting food at a dining hall, the mugger slalom, and having a grad student grade your term paper.

Another philosophical question that has plagued us recently is the epistemological problem of Yale’s existence. [pause] While there seems to be plenty of evidence to support it we believe there is ample room for doubt. True, our last two presidents claim to be Yale graduates, but their respective performances in office suggest a complete lack of education. This does not prove that Yale doesn’t exist, however, because it is consistent with the level of academic rigor supposedly found there. Watch now as the band forms John Rawls’ veil of ignorance and plays “Subjective Man Born.”

Plagued with uncertainty, we finally made a journey to aromatic New Haven to see for ourselves. Our experience there was reminiscent of a trip to the movie theatre. The streets were like the aftermath of a Twister: maybe the aliens from Independence Day blew up New Haven and nobody noticed. In any case we all had to show Courage Under Fire because the lifestyle was straight out of Trainspotting. For a while we thought it would be a Mission: Impossible ever to Escape From New Haven, but we did finally reach the spot of the alleged university only to find what appeared to be a penitentiary of some sort. Watch now as the Brown Band presents the Yale Jail as Jericho in hopes that the house of cards that is its reputation will soon come crumbling down.

:sd[Band forms big wall and plays “Joshua”]

:sd[Band forms “B” during following latin gibberish]

QED: Quando erat demonstrandum. Cogito ergo sum. Quid pro quo. Ex post facto. Arma virumque cano. In java speramus. Semper ubi sub ubi. And in conclusion, we suspect that Yale University is actually a large-scale hoax perpetrated by either the CIA, the Illuminati, or the well known super-secret society Skull and Bones. :sd[one member of the band discreetly leaves the formation and walks off the field] Join us next week to see the band braves the killer-mosquito infested wilds of Southern Rhode Island when the bears take on URI. Until then, we would like to join the humane society in reminding you to have your Bulldog spayed or neutered.
