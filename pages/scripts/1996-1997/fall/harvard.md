## Halftime:

Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and Harvard students, presenting an organization that needs all that fertilizer for gardening. . . honestly! All our hydroponics equipment was confiscated during the moratorium! It’s the Brown University-- Hey, wait a second, whose purple backpack is that?

:sd[Band flees endzone screaming, leaving a purple backpack behind]

It’s really great to be performing once again at UMass Cambridge, you’re all beautiful people. Anybody here from out of town? We really hope our show doesn’t bomb. We want you to like us-- so here’s a present for you. Watch out though, the postmark is from somewhere in Montana.

Watch now, ladies and gentlemen, as the Brown Band spontaneously combusts.

If somebody wants something strongly enough, in certain situations they seek to sell their soul to Satan. At Harvard they don’t place stock in such silliness, but they do have the next best thing-- groveling to Gates.

It might have come to some as a surprise how Harvard garnered a healthy bequest from Bill for their new building, leaving a once-mighty university on its knees to a modern-day Mephistopheles. We may even wonder: How hard up was Harvard to go to Goethe and unfurl the Faust flag? It certainly wasn’t out of a thirst for knowledge (this is, after all, Harvard we’re talking about).

More likely it was one of the seven deadly sins: We suspect that the Crimsons envied Brown, although they were not driven (as one might suspect) by envy for Brown’s renowned Computer Science department, but rather by Harvard’s hankering to have a big ugly hole in the ground of their very own. That fraud Freud never mentioned anything about crater envy, but it has been the downfall of many a virtuous university.

Watch now, ladies and gentlemen, as the Brown University Microsoft Band forms a great big hole in the ground and plays the Crater Envy Polka.

This year marks John Keats’ 200th anniversary, and the Brown Band’s crack team of literary historians has recently unearthed a previously unknown collaboration between John Keats and John Harvard. It turns out that it was the two Johns working together who wrote the little-known masterpiece “Commode on a Grecian Urn.” The lyric deals with a Greek vase being brought to the Peabody Museum by a Harvard student. Tragedy strikes when the student tries to take the train and ends up drowning because he never needed to use the library.

Watch now as the still unravished Band of Brown University, foster children of volume and cut time, salute Keats by forming John’s urn and playing "Birthday."

Join us next week when Brown plays Dartmouth and the band unveils its giant pair of maracas.
