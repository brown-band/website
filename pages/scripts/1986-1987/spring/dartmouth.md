Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, back from the third leg of the America’s Cup where they raised the spirits of many by being athletic supporters down under; it’s the Brown University; “Give us six million dollars or else Oral Roberts will live” Band.

:sd[Band skates out onto ice]

In the name of subtle satire, the Band presents the Phlegm Bulletin on ice. This week don’t miss our amazing Ronald Reagan prostate retrospective. That’s right, we will show all three of the major networks’ prime time specials on the President’s prostate-- and in 3-D. So come on out and relive this truly historic moment. Plus, as an added incentive, anyone who can acurately draw the aforementioned piece of anatomy will get in free. Semiotics concentrators are disqualified. The Band now forms an arthroscope on the ice and plays “Wide World of Prostate Surgery.”

In other _Neus_, the Dean of the College Harriet Sheridan announced her plans to retire. The Band believes it is odd that such a statement has occurred when the Reagan Administration is looking for a replacement for CIA director William Casey. In fact, we believe the two might even be the same person. After all, is it more than mere coincidence that they have never been seen together in the same place? And what about that course the Dean teaches? Am Civ 007x: Espionage, My Way. When our Band investigative reporter pressed the Dean on the issue, she responded with a quick karate chop to the groin area. Without drawing any conclusions, the Band forms the Dean’s favorite drink, a coffee cabinet-- shaken, not stirred-- and plays “Spy Stuff.”

Be back February 21st when the Band says Big Jake.
