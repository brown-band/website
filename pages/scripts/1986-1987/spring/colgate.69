Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, it's the Brown University "We don't play no crap!" Band!
</sp>
<sp>
This week, a subject of immense proportions aroused the interest of the band. Yes, National Condom Week has come upon us once again, and we feel it's time to give our audience a few <i>pointers.</i> As stock in prophylactic manufacturers continues to <i>rise,</i> numbers of major corporations plan to enter this enticing area. Slice will be presenting condoms with 10% real fruit juice. Diet Coke plans to market edible condoms, "just for the taste of it." The Chrysler Corporation will be offering its "Ram Tough" condoms with the slogan "NOT born in America." The band salutes these efforts by unfurling its own protection plan, and playing "Rubber Duckie."<sbr/>

In response to ABC television's controversial series "Amerika," several other networks are planning to air different versions of the drama. Forsythe County, Georgia will be the setting of Ted Turner's multimillion-dollar epic, "Amerik-k-ka," spelled A-M-E-R-I-K-K-K-A. Elmer Fudd will star in the Looney Toons productions, "Amewika." Dyslexics Untied will be offering "Aremika." In a somewhat unrelated media event, an Israeli crew has just arrived in Providence to begin production of the new rock musical, "Jacob and the Amazing Technicolor Klutznick Chair."<sbr/>
