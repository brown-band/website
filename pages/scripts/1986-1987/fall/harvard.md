## Halftime

:sd[in T.V. evangelist voice] Good afternoon brothers and sisters and welcome to Harvard, the Oral Roberts of the North. I’m here today to warn y’all against a sinister and heathen force in our society which is corrupting our rosy cheeked youth. Of course, y’all know I could only be talking about one thing. And that is the Brown University “they sold their souls for rock-n-roll” Band!

:sd[the Band runs out onto the field]

:sd[still in same voice] Why can’t the youth of our America follow a more wholesome role model? I have in mind a pious and upright mainstay of society which was founded right here in Cambridge when the Pilgrims landed in 1669 and is still possessed by that Puritan and ascetic zeal. I am speaking of none other than the Harvard Band. Though even these high standing members were befallen by hard times and labeled heretics they were quick to confess their sins and have worn a scarlet letter H ever since as a symbol of their repentance. Now we need your help to save the wretched Brown souls that you see on the field before you. A small donation of $16,000 will enable one of these poor sinners to attend that bastion of virtue, Harvard. To make a donation, please call the toll free number at the bottom of your field, that’s 1-020-304-0504. Watch now as the Band forms that holy communicator, the T.V., and plays Gospel John.

The Band was recently gratified when both I.B.M. and G.M. announced the pullout of their massive organizations from deep inside the bush country of South Africa. Fearing that the white pillars of apartheid might tremble, the companies promised to pull out slowly so that no seeds of revolt would accidentally be planted. To celebrate this climactic event, the Band forms a ship leaving port with all seamen aboard and plays “California, Here I Come.”

It was one of these Knights in which no Ray of hope could be found. Owen to the Mookie weather, both teams were feeling a bit Nipper. On the Boston bench, the team felt as if they were Bogged down in a Strawberry jam, and though they tried to Wade it out, they could not find a Baylor strong enough. So, until next year, the Boston area will just have to hand up their Spikes and grin and Barret. Watch now as the Band forms a noose on the field and plays “McNamara’s Band.”

Be back in two years when Harvard celebrates the second anniversary of its 350th anniversary.
