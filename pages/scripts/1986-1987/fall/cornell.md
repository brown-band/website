## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization which believes cow tipping is just a ploy to raise Cornell's endowment: it's the Brown University "We're not a band, but we play one on T.V." Band!

:sd[Band runs onto field]

In light of the disinformation scandal, the Brown Band feels that certain crucial questions need to be asked. Like, Ronald Regan, who is he really? Will he be able to get his system up and working in the next ten years? Will Nancy just say no? What is really floating around in those bottles of California Coolers? Is Cornell a state school, or do they just pretend to be one? How many miles to Ithaca or by cow? Do I know what I'm saying? Or, is this all just a lot of "Talk Around the Clock"?

The band has learned that this disinformation scandal is much more serious than first thought. For instance, sources have discovered that Moammar "Wildman" Khaddafi is actually a retired insurance salesman from Butte, Montana and his greatest excitement comes from playing with two bards at Wednesday night Bingo. We also know that Nicaragua is actually a Club Med get-away being used as a tax shelter for high ranking government officials. Furthermore, we learned Lyndon LaRouche is really a synthesized image of Ricardo Montalban created by Jesse Helms as a joke to annoy Democrats. Finally, it has been revealed that the true purpose of Reagan's and Gorbachev's meeting in Iceland was to collaborate on their soon-to-be released rap video Super Summit Shuffle. The Band now forms Regan's nose on the field and plays "Ronny's Fanfare."

Band? Band! Wake up, what are you doing lying on the field? Stop dreaming, Bobby's still alive. Now go get ready to do the halftime show.

:sd[Band runs to endzone]

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you professors outstanding in your field with the rest of the cows, it's the Brown University "I have this strange feeling I've done this before" Band!

:sd[Band runs out onto field]

The Brown Band has herd that Cornell students were mooooved to respond to their administration's milking of South Africa. While the Band remains inCUDulous at such udder folly, it does not wish to make any hits below the belt on such a tender subject. The Band, therefore, makes a helpful suggestion by erecting an alternate structure on the field and playing "Bothacabana."

Hey Band! Don't you know that's illegal here? But I guess you have made your point. Now get off the field.
