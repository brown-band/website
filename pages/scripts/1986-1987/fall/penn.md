## Halftime

Some things are safe, others are risky, still others are dangerous... but this is totally irrelevant.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Quaker Oafs, it's the Brown University "some of our best friends are football players" Band! :sd[Band runs out onto field]

Recent letters in The Brown Daily Herald have alleged, much to our surprise, that Brown students do not idolize football players. The Band would like to make an editorial reply in an effort to rectify this heinous situation. We had suggested putting yardlines on the Green and turning the flagpole into a goalpost, but the administration blocked the attempted conversion. Trying to recover our fumbled plan at glorifying the gridders, band members Dart into formation to worship their favorite player's number and play "Greatest Brunonian Hero"

Turning from varsity sports to water sports, the Brown Band probes a sensitive issue on campus: "gang bathrooms." The band ponders the implications of this concept. Does it mean:

:::script-list

- a) we'll be chained to the sinks
- b) Hell's Angels will do wheelies in our stalls
- c) we'll be showering with Spanky and Alfalfa
- or f) "the Princeton Band."

The Band warns the student population of possible ramifications of this new policy by forming a potential bathroom hazard, a bar of soap on the shower floor, while playing "Gospel John."

Two weeks ago, the Band was "wowed" by former President Jimmy "crack corn" Carter's stirring speech on the Green. Encouraging Carter to enter the Rhode Island gubernatorial race, the Band joined forces with the Beef-n-Bun to promote the Jimmy Gimme Campaign. If elected, Carter promises to stage a sit-in at I.B.M. and to fast until Eric Lowery turns Black. He also promises to veto the controversial "Amendment 14" so that he can legally abort any future hostage rescue attempts. Watch now as the Band forms a lever on the field and casts its vote while playing "Everything's Coming Up Peanuts."

Be back on Parents' weekend when the Band gets 7 to 20 years.
