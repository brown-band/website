Good day fair ladies, are you well?<sbr/>
And worthy Lords whom we will tell
</sp>
<sp>
A noble story from a Band<sbr/>
Who trav'leth wide across the land.<sbr/>
    <sbr/>
From Dartmouth far and Princeton near,<sbr/>
We drink our port and chug our beer.
</sp>
<sp>
With rum and gin and bourbon mash,<sbr/>
As much we need to get us trashed
</sp>
<sp>
Tequila shots and Everclear,<sbr/>
We drink to numb our being here.
</sp>
<sp>
We drink and slurp and slug...sorry.
</sp>
<sp>
Good friends who sit with double chin<sbr/>
and ancient grads within this inn,
</sp>
<sp>
We come to play and do it well<sbr/>
If you're displeased then go to...Columbia.
</sp>
<sp>
Sublime and peachy music swells <sbr/>
When we present the Brown minstrels.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band runs out onto the field</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
Let's tell the epic of these swains <sbr/>
A football team their college feigns.
</sp>
<sp>
Two score and eight long months have passed<sbr/>
Since victory graced Columbia last.
</sp>
<sp>
They've prayed to Zeus and Lady Luck <sbr/>
To no avail for they still suck.
</sp>
<sp>
They've tried so hard to work some magic<sbr/>
But woe! Their record's best deemed tragic.
</sp>
<sp>
Their deft maneuvers are no good <sbr/>
They play as well as blind nuns would.
</sp>
<sp>
To count the tournaments they've fought<sbr/>
And won, we form a great big nought.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms a circle on the field and plays "I've Got Plenty of Nuttin'"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
    New Amsterdam's a jolly town<sbr/>
    Where muggers, crack, and sluts abound.
</sp>
<sp>
    A tryst costs just a meager sum<sbr/>
    For seven ducats thou canst come...by a lovely lass.
</sp>
<sp>
    Forsooth, anon, New York's a dump<sbr/>
    The city's in eternal slump.
</sp>
<sp>
    A fragrant blossom it is not <sbr/>
    It smells just like a chamber pot.
</sp>
<sp>
    With this in mind we bite our thumb<sbr/>
    And play a song that's really dumb.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms a thumb on the field and plays "I Hear You Knocking..."</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
    But 'sblood and 'splooge<smdash/>you've no reknown,<sbr/>
    Let's sing the praises of old Brown.
</sp>
<sp>
    Without a doubt our best resource<sbr/>
    Is gobs of social intercourse.
</sp>
<sp>
    Columbia men might find it hard<sbr/>
    Were thay to merge with old Barnard.
</sp>
<sp>
    From segregation Brown is free<sbr/>
    Both sexes live in harmony
</sp>
<sp>
    There's more to Brown than just romance<sbr/>
    We give athletics half a chance.
</sp>
<sp>
    At least we've won a game or two<sbr/>
    Or three or four<smdash/>now how 'bout you?
</sp>
<sp>
    Although you've games of every sort,<sbr/>
    You do not play our favorite sport.
</sp>
<sp>
    The Ivy League's most treasured dream<sbr/>
    At least we have a hockey team.
</sp>
<sp>
    But as recourse may suggest <sbr/>
    You institute the game of chess.
</sp>
<sp>
    Upon this lush and verdant lawn<sbr/>
    We form for you a lowly pawn.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band forms a pawn on the field and plays "Wide World of Sports"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
    We'll see you next November time<sbr/>
    You shall not hear our stupid rhyme.
</sp>
<sp>
<sd>Band marches off to "Ever True..."</sd> <sbr/>
