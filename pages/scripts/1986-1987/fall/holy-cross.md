## Halftime

By order of the Edwin Meese Commission on fallacious legislation for homogeneous morals, we have been requested to ask you, the viewing audience, not to watch the following half-time presentation.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you freshman mummies and daddies... and their parents; it's the Brown University "We haven't made up this line yet. If you have any suggestions or donations, please send them to the Brown University Band, Box 1930, Student Activities Office" Band!

:sd[Band runs onto field]

:sd[In normal low voice] Welcome to Mr. Rogers' neighborhood, with Director of Admissions James Rogers.

:sd[In Mister Rogers' voice] Hi there band! Will you be my neighbor? Today we're going on a tour of Brown University and we're going to start right here in my office. Can you say big donation? If so, then you can say matriculation. They rhyme. :sd[Band has formed dollar sign on field] Say Band, you catch on very quickly. Now you too can be a "Big Spender"

:sd[Band plays "Big Spender"]

Say, isn't that Health Services over there? And here's Toby Simon. She's a special Dean. She knows a lot of good games, boys and girls. :sd[the Band has formed three lines on the field] Toby Simon says take a step forward if you believe there is such a thing as safe sex. :sd[two Band members, one male and one female, take a step forward from the front line; the rest of the Band steps backward] O.K., now take off all your clothes! Uh, oh! Simon didn't say that. :sd[small chuckle] Moving from libidinal emissions to nocturnal admissions, we have Dean Robinson. Say Band, can you form a B12 capsule on the field and play "Break In at Midnight?" I thought you could.

:sd[the Band forms a capsule on the field and plays "Rockin' at Midnight"]

Hey Band, what's that smell? Can you say Ratty? They're having a special dinner tonight. Let's go take a look. Oh my! It's chicken :sd[said with sarcastic excitement] Just look at all the succulent meat. You can have :sd[say as if mouth is beginning to water more and more] chicken legs... chicken thighs... chicken breasts... BEEEEEEEEEEP!

:sd[In normal low voice] This is an actual demonstration of the Edwin Meese Emergency Censor System. This is not a test. Watch now as the Band forms the only uncensorable food, Wonderbread, and plays "Yummy, Yummy, Yummy."

:sd[the Band forms a slice of bread on the field and plays "Yummy, Yummy, Yummy"]

Be back in two weeks when Brown puts the squeeze on Colgate.

:sd[the Band marches off to "Ever True..."]
