## Halftime

Good day fair ladies, are you well?\
 And worthy Lords whom we will tell

A noble story from a Band\
 Who trav'leth wide across the land.

From Dartmouth far and Princeton near,\
 We drink our port and chug our beer.

With rum and gin and bourbon mash,\
 As much we need to get us trashed

Tequila shots and Everclear,\
 We drink to numb our being here.

We drink and slurp and slug...sorry.

Good friends who sit with double chin\
 and ancient grads within this inn,

We come to play and do it well\
 If you're displeased then go to...Columbia.

Sublime and peachy music swells\
 When we present the Brown minstrels.

:sd[Band runs out onto the field]

Let's tell the epic of these swains\
 A football team their college feigns.

Two score and eight long months have passed\
 Since victory graced Columbia last.

They've prayed to Zeus and Lady Luck\
 To no avail for they still suck.

They've tried so hard to work some magic\
 But woe! Their record's best deemed tragic.

Their deft maneuvers are no good\
 They play as well as blind nuns would.

To count the tournaments they've fought\
 And won, we form a great big nought.

:sd[Band forms a circle on the field and plays "I've Got Plenty of Nuttin'"]

New Amsterdam's a jolly town\
 Where muggers, crack, and sluts abound.

A tryst costs just a meager sum\
 For seven ducats thou canst come...by a lovely lass.

Forsooth, anon, New York's a dump\
 The city's in eternal slump.

A fragrant blossom it is not\
 It smells just like a chamber pot.

With this in mind we bite our thumb\
 And play a song that's really dumb.

:sd[Band forms a thumb on the field and plays "I Hear You Knocking..."]

But 'sblood and 'splooge—you've no reknown,\
 Let's sing the praises of old Brown.

Without a doubt our best resource\
 Is gobs of social intercourse.

Columbia men might find it hard\
 Were thay to merge with old Barnard.

From segregation Brown is free\
 Both sexes live in harmony

There's more to Brown than just romance\
 We give athletics half a chance.

At least we've won a game or two\
 Or three or four—now how 'bout you?

Although you've games of every sort,\
 You do not play our favorite sport.

The Ivy League's most treasured dream\
 At least we have a hockey team.

But as recourse may suggest\
 You institute the game of chess.

Upon this lush and verdant lawn\
 We form for you a lowly pawn.

:sd[Band forms a pawn on the field and plays "Wide World of Sports"]

We'll see you next November time\
 You shall not hear our stupid rhyme.

:sd[Band marches off to "Ever True..."]
