Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization whose left foot doesn’t know what its right foot is doing—sort of like one of our national Presidents; it’s the Brown University “Master skating” Band!

While accidently searching through confidential files in various departments, the Band came across questions which are being used on finals this semester. In the holiday spirit, we would like to share them with you. On the Engin 9 multiple choice exam: “You are the editor of Rhode Island’s second largest daily morning newspaper. Do you a) jump off the Sci Li.” For Geo 5: “Which is larger, the Sun or the Moon? Explain.” On the exam for UC 135, Alcohol, Health, and Culture: “Under the chair you will find a jug of Mad Dog wine and a liter of Smirnoff. Consume the above and describe how your perceptions of society change. A hefty bag is provided on the seat in front of you.” Finally, for Organic Chem: “If the heat of combustion of cyclopropane is 500 kilocalories per mole and the heat of combustion of tetrachloroethylene is 491.9 kilocalories per mole, prove that God exists.” The Band forms the grade it expects to get in both of its courses and plays “Mission Impossible.”

Moving from incomplete to incompetent, President Reagan is once again living up to the motto, “Those who can, do; those who can’t, lead.” The Band Was shocked to hear of the further deterioration of the President’s mental faculties. Just last Wednesday, Ron was heard mumbling, “Nancy is it all right if I bring that monkey to the Senate hearing tonight?” It was also rumored that Reagan had asked Lt. Col. Oliver North if he was a good witch or a bad witch. Watch now as the Band creates another scandal on the ice and profits by forming a tow missile and plays “Reagan’s Heroes.”

The Band exits to its annual holiday party where there’s always rum for one more.
