## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, presenting an organization which needs no introduction..

:sd[Band runs out onto field]

Hi. Do you know us? We offend unsuspecting football fans everywhere we go. But sometimes, when we're not on the field playing with our instruments, people fail to fulfill our desire for recognition. That's why we carry the American Distress Card. Now, whenever we get that urge to turn people's head, we deftly whip it out and get the attention we deserve. The American Distress Card. Don't splooge without it.

Serious crimes were neglected this week in the Brown Daily Herald; hence, the Band feels it necessary to present its own pair of Police Briefs. On Saturday, November 1, there was yet another assault by the John Carter Brown Library. This time, the victim was Rhode Island Hall. The two monolithic structures battled it out on the Green for 35 minutes. Witnesses reported seeing the John Rockefeller Library near the scene of the crime. Brown security said the fight left broken glass, rubble, and (using low resounding voice) MUD...TONS OF MUD (normal voice) all over the Green and that (same low resounding voice) IT'LL TAKE ALL WEEK TO CLEAN UP!

Also, an exhibitionist was reported hanging out on Manning street. Police were reluctant to apprehend the man, fearing he might shoot at any moment. Later they admitted that they weren't sure if he was carrying a gun, or was just glad to see them. The Band salutes our fine security force by forming its most offensive weapon and playing "Rubber Truncheon."

The Band waited eagerly for the outcome of this past week's elections. Expanding upon the old adage, "old politicians never die, they just get impeached by campus radicals," the Band contemplates what has happened to the losers. Rumor has it that Susan Farmer has entered the Coor's Lite Motor Sports circuit and can be seen tonight at the Providence civic center slinging—you guessed it—(one more time, a low resounding voice) MUD...TONS OF MUD. Arlene Violet was last reported to be running back to her convent on her knees in hopes of getting back into the habit of courting higher authorities. And finally, Zechariah Chafee is apparently back on the campaign trail for '88 and has allegedly been soliciting in the Faunce House Men's Room. The Band forms its favorite political symbol, a Cool Moose, and plays "Election Day People."
