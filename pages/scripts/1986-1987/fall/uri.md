## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and any other bodies who may be lying around under the field, it's the Johnson and Wales "Brown wouldn't come here even if this weren't a graveyard" Band!

The Brown Band wanted to be here today but were swept up in a tornado and landed on a farmhouse somewhere in Kansas. Not wanting to deny U.R.I. a quality half-time show, Brown asked other area schools to go on its behalf. R.I.S.D. declined the offer because "like the stifling man-made gridlines imposed upon the naturalistic background presented way too many unresolved aesthetic conflicts." When Brown asked the New England Tech Graduates, they said they couldn't compete, especially on a field that wasn't state of the aht. Providence College considered coming here, but then had second thoughts and withdrew. And Rhode Island College? Well, they thought U-R-I were their initials. The Band begins to rethink its trip to South Kingston and plays "Does Anybody Really Know Who We Are?"

To help celebrate Rhode Island's 350th birthday, the Band would like to present yet another exciting anniversary minute. In 1636 Roger Williams first landed on Moonstone Beach, then a favorite fishing ground for local savages â€“ some things never change. Upon landing, he discovered the first Rhode Island quahog. Roger was inspired to create a new children's toy: the Hasbro Mr. Quagoghead. Though this novel idea did not work out when it was learned that quahogs don't have heads, only little necks, it did lay the foundation for Rhode Island's famous high tech industries. The Band salutes Rhode Island's enterprising accomplishments by forming a simulated pearl on the field and playing "I Got Plenty Of Costume Jewelry."

The Johnson and Wales Band would like to take this time to alert the American public to a subversive trend in today's society: (dramatic pause) violence against food. We see it everywhere, people mashing their potatoes, beating their eggs and whipping their cream. But it gets wurst. There are the glossy magazines which promote the senseless exploitation of vegetables, showing only the surface of culinary delights. These pictures entice the American public to drool and masticate... Look it up. Only last month, Weight Watchers magazine put out its infamous summer food edition with a ten page cheeze spread. At Johnson and Wales, we have banned the sale of publications like Bon Appetit, Gourmet, and Better Homes and Gardens. We have also established a Sarah Lee Center For Battered Fish. To get involved, just call our 800 number, it's 1-800-E-A-T-M-E-A-T; that's right, 1-800-E-A-T-M-E-A-T. And if you call today, you can get a free Ginsu Knife. Watch now as the Band forms the most heinous food known to mankind, the taco, and plays "Classical Gas."

We now return to our regularly scheduled football game, already in progress.
