Now folks, wasn't that the biggest bunch of bull...dogs you've ever seen? How about something attractive to fewer flies? 
</sp>
<sp>
    Ladies and gentlemen, friends and alumni, and all you women of the Ivy League; it's the Brown University "Banned<smdash/>as in not sold at 7-11 stores" Band!!
</sp>
<sp>
    The Band comes back to Providence this year with a change of heart. No longer do we want to poke fun at our institutions or insult the other team. Yes, the band rises above its murky past<smdash/>like grease on a Ratty hamburger. In an age where Joe McCarthy would be branded a liberal, the Band is inspired to a new height of patriotism. <sbr/>
<sd>Small group of bandies begin to play "National Emblem March"</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
    The band was deeply touched by Hands Across America. After all, it's reassuring to know that it's still constitutional to love thy neighbor, except possibly in Georgia. And who could ever forget the Goodwill Games <sd>long pause</sd>, Ted Turner's humanitarian gesture to ease world tension<smdash/>and apparently for no profit at all. Wouldn't a Brown diploma look good now, Ted? Finally, feeling left out of the celebration of the summer, the Band salutes that beautiful lady, Ms. Liberty, by raising its own torch and playing "Come on lady, Light My Fire."<sbr/>
<sd>The Band forms a torch on the field and plays "Light My Fire." Near the end, a foot comes down on the torch and stamps it out.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
    In local news, the Band has learned of several changes the administration has in store for the Brown campus this year.
</sp>
<sul>
<sli>a) to convert Oliver's into a computer center </sli>
<sli>b) to convert Rogers into a big computer center</sli>
<sli>c) to convert Marvel Gym into a really, really big computer center</sli>
<sli>d) to convert White Hall into Monty Hall</sli>
<sli>e) to convert the Rock into a library </sli>
<sli>and f) the Princeton Band! </sli>
</sul>
<sp>
    Turning to sports, in an unprecedented trade with the National League, Brown acquired ex-Yale President and future bat boy A. Bartlett Giamatti in exchange for the Menu Lady and a provost to be named later. But getting back to matters at hand, the Band looks forward to the upcoming football season and plays "Ivy League Today."<sbr/>
<sd>The band plays "N.F.L. Today" while forming the Playboy logo on the field.</sd>
</sp>
<sp>
    On a serious note, the Brown Band would like to thank the alumni who have given us so much support over the past years. And to demonstrate that your support has had an impact in today's troubled times of decaying literacy, the Band will prove its penmanship by writing "Brown" on the field and playing our Alma Mater.<sbr/>
<sd>To a drum cadence, the Band walks into the word "Brön" in script and then plays the Alma Mater.</sd>

    See you next week in Kingston when the Bruins get ram tough with U.R.I.<sbr/>
