## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you concupiscent Cantabridgians, it's the Brown University "What! You're having a party and didn't invite us?" Band!

:sd[Band runs out onto field]

Whenever the Band comes here to Cambridge it is always amazed about the amount of construction that is... Woah! Wait a minute Band! :sd[Band stops running] Band, are you sober enough to know where we are? :sd[Band puts hands up in the air and shouts, "NO!"] Judging from the profusion of tacky orange and black clothing, I think we're in :sd[short dramatic pause] Princeton! :sd[Band scatters, continues to run around screaming in apparent panic] Oh, I'm sorry, folks, but I guess we sort of, well, got you confused with Harvard. I'm sure you'll all agree, it's a very easy mistake. But I guess we should have known better; after all, Harvard does have some sort of reputation. The Band has calmed itself down on the field by forming its favorite pacifier, a bottle of Jack Daniels, and playing "Band Bus Blues."

During its long hard exhausting drive from the ocean state, the Band came up with a novel approach for easing world tension: imperialism. To begin, we suggest taking over Canada. Just think of all the natural resources like maple syrup, hockey players, and Alex Trebec. And everyone would speak American. After all, who needs a language that greets people, "Bon jour monster, come untie my shoe?" We must admit, though, that one potential drawback to our plan would be the danger of being shutout in the Northwestern now impersonates the Royal Canadian Mounted Police by forming Dudley Do-right on the field and playing "Hey, take me over, eh, you hosers."

The Band has come across some disturbing news. It has learned that recently released reporter Nicholas Daniloff was tortured while in KGB prison by being fed:

Moving from things hard to swallow to indoor water sports, the Band admires new Princetonian land uses. Watch now as it pulls out its surf board on the field and conquers the local pipeline by surfing Jadwin while it plays "Jadwin 5-0."

The Brown Band is an equal opportunity offender.
