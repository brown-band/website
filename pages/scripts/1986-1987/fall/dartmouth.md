## Pregame

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you pillars of prehistoric promiscuity: It’s the Brown University Band that Time Forgot!!!

:sd[Band runs out and forms primordial soup]

In the beginning, before there were suicide pills, hot colleges and shanties on the green, there was :sd[dramatic pause] The Brown Band. And it was good. Then, out of the primordial soup crawled the Class of 1987. :sd[lightly] And they were good too. To survive the hostile environment of ONLIWONs, citizens’ arrests and turkey tetrazini the class of ’87 discovered they needed lots of "Hot Stuff."

:sd[Band plays "Hot Stuff".]

:sd[Band forms a volcano with seniors in the pool of magma]

We now take you back to the bygone days when pterodactyls roosted in the eaves of Rogers, when Raquel Welch and Ringo Starr foraged in the Airport lounge and when Whitehall stood tall among the Sleestaks.

As we sift through the rubble and hit bedrock, we strike upon the highlights of a Brown Band senior’s evolution:

- A. Beaver Stadium, where we learned that we were not Penn State.
- B. Toro lawnmowers, livestock and a full moon near New Jersey at the Gross National Parade.
- C. The glorious rumbling, fleshpiling, smutting and booting on our mobile motor coaches.
- D. Taking our act to national television and obliging the screams of "Encore!"
- E. Shaved tails at the Flagpost where we refused to:
- F. The Princeton Band.

## Halftime

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Alumni, and all you Dartmouth animal lovers; it’s the Brown University "Unidentified Flying" Band.

Welcome to this week’s episode of :sd[low vibrating voice] Band in Space. These are the voyages of the Brown Band; on a four year mission to seek out and find new and unexplored worlds, like the inside of a UCS election booth, the Faunce House Men’s Room, and Wil Robinson. To hurtle through space at incredible speeds just for the hell of it. To discover the answer to the eternal mystery of where Brown students take their dates and why? :sd[final dramatic statement] To go where no woman has gone before...like Dartmouth. The Brown Band forms its aimlessly wandering rocket on the field and plays "Star Blazers."

:sd[the Band forms a rocket on the field and plays "Star Blazers"]

When last we left, Daveth "Vader" McCloughlin, the sheepish leader of the small colony Darmonia on the planet Hanovery, was defending his city from the attempted overthrow by the exiled Dartmonian coed, Gonad the Ovarian. Last seen, Gonad was descending upon the fortified walls of the city, only to be repelled after falling to secure a safe hold. To illustrate these aborted attacks, the Band forms the city gates and plays "I Hear You Knocking, But You Can’t Come In."

:sd[the Band takes the form of the closed city gates and plays "I Hear You Knocking..."]

Meanwhile, upon hearing of the turmoil on the planet Hanovery, our heroes, the Brown Band, go to the rescue. On the way, they pass by the forgotten planet of Ethanol. Scanners show the atmosphere to be 66.6% Everclear grain alcohol vapors. Naturally, the Band decides to stop and tank up. Now our heroes really are in space and end up in orbit around another planet. Back on Hanovery, though, things do not look so good. The ramparts of Dartmonia have fallen and ruin seems inevitable. But since any resemblance to any Ivy League school, real or fictional, is purely intentional, who cares? The Band tells the final fate of Dartmonia by playing "Joshua" as the walls come tumbling down.

:sd[the Band forms a rectangle on the field which collapses as they play "Joshua"]

Be back hockey season when the Brown Band, still flying high, serves itself up over ice.

:sd[the Band marches off to "Ever True..."]
