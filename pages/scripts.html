summary: The Brown Band shows possess a unique satirical humor that only could come from the twisted minds of our members.  Although many hours of brainstorming go into each script, the true talent behind our show is our scriptwriters.  Pay attention to the names that appear on the season's page!  So if you are ready, choose a season below.

  <p>
    <em>
      <strong>Please note</strong>: As with any organization, the culture of the
      Brown Band has changed over the years and such, the content of the scripts
      has evolved to reflect this change. The band strives to be a welcoming,
      diverse and thoughtful community and the current band members do not
      condone any scripts that appear contrary to this goal.</em
