The Brown Band is supported in part by Brown University Athletics and Recreation. Gifts through the Brown University Sports Foundation help support additional operational costs including instrument purchases and repair, uniforms, travel and, of course, band buttons. All gifts through the Sports Foundation are included in the Brown Annual Fund and are eligible for membership in the Brown Annual Fund’s recognition societies. Thank you for your support!

#### Centennial Goals

In our 100th year, the Band is hoping to raise $100,000. This ambitious goal will work to support the following:

- Operating Expenses: Every year the Band needs to raise 20k - 25k so that we can attend most away football games (buses are expensive!), have food at events and trips, buy buttons (an expense of around $6,000 a year), and other miscellaneous operating expenses not covered by our Athletics Budget.
- Centennial Activities: The Band looks to celebrate our incredible milestone with a variety of events and developments, including a Gala on September 28th, new music, merchandise and buttons for the centennial, and a centennial recording of the band’s greatest hits.
- New Percussion Instruments: The Band is in dire need of new percussion instruments, and has been quoted $28,000 to replace the full section. The Band would additionally like to replace or repair instruments across all sections that are in need of a “tune-up,” especially large instruments that students do not typically own (low brass, baritone saxophones, etc.)

We would greatly appreciate your support at any level towards the Band. Starting this year, the Band is recognizing support on our website, the Gala program, and in The Bandstand (our biannual newsletter) at the following levels:

- “Button Benefactor”, $169.69-499.99
- “Forevermore Circle”, $500.00-999.99
- “Ever True Circle”, $1,000.00-2,499.99
- “Conductor’s Circle”, $2,500.00-4,999.99
- “Elrod Society”, $5,000.00-9,999.99
  - Donations at this level that are received by April 15, 2025 will be engraved on a plaque to be hung in Fulton Rehearsal Hall, to honor champions of our centennial campaign.
- “Irving Harris Founders Circle”, $10,000.00+
  - Donations at this level that are received by April 15, 2025 will be engraved on a plaque to be hung in Fulton Rehearsal Hall, to honor champions of our centennial campaign.
