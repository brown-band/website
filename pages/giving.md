The Brown Band is supported in part by Brown University Athletics and Recreation. Gifts through the Brown University Sports Foundation help support additional operational costs including instrument purchases and repair, uniforms, travel and, of course, band buttons. All gifts through the Sports Foundation are included in the Brown Annual Fund and are eligible for membership in the Brown Annual Fund’s recognition societies. Thank you for your support!
