title = "Arranging Music"
+++

Members of the Brown Band are encouraged to arrange music for the Band to play! Some of our favorite songs are arrangements by current and past members of the Band.\
If you are interested in arranging, you should let the [conductors](/leadership/#conductors) know before you get started! We’d be happy to give you suggestions, and we’ll check our library to make sure you don’t arrange a song we already have.

Once you have finished arranging, email the PDF to the librarians at [band_librarians@brown.edu](mailto:band_librarians@brown.edu). 

## Standards For Brown Band Arrangements

**Page Size**: 4.5″x6.5″ recommended, absolute maximum is 5″x7″\
**Instrumentation**:

- Piccolo and Flute can be combined
- 1 Flute part, although 2 parts is also ok
- 2 B flat clarinet parts
- 2 Alto Saxophone parts
- Tenor Saxophone
- Bari Saxophone
- Horn in F
- 2 Trombone parts
- Baritone TC and BC (can be combined)
- 3 Trumpet parts
- Tuba
- Percussion:
  - Snare
  - Bass
  - Cymbals
  - Quads
  - Bells

**Other Notes**:

- Keep measure numbers on the left side at the beginning of the lines, letters throughout the rest in a box (usually every 8 to 10 measures, enough for rehearsal marks)
- The more articulations, the better. Include speed, style, metronome marking, etc.
- Create hard copies and PDF files.
- Be sure to print enough copies of each part. Ideally, a minimum of 10 of each part will ensure that we have enough to use now, as well as for replacements.
- Bind scores on the left edge, not at the top. They should look like a notebook.
