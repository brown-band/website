year = 26
bio = "Owen is from North Providence, RI, but you probably knew that already from their last tour of duty on band board. In band they can usually be found playing the sousaphone(but are currently trying to learn the trombone to varying degrees of success), contrary to their last statement on the website(sorry S&M). Owen studies Biomedical Engineering, with lofty(albeit maybe misguided) goals of pursuing grad school post bacc, and definitely will NOT take a job at Raytheon or Lockheed Martin. Outside of band, Owen is part of AVGE and Tech House, where they play bass(beabadoobee reference?) and engage in whatever niche interests they have at the time. If you see Owen walking around and they don't say hi don't take it personally, they're probably operating off of -4 hours of sleep and coffee from the Ratty while attempting to finish a problem set to no avail. It’s chill though."

year = 27
bio = "Isabella hails from the ever so lovely ‘city’ of Montgomery Village, Maryland and never seems to know how close to Baltimore they actually are. She is in the percussion section where she plays ~~far too loudly~~ the snare drum. Academically, she plans on double concentrating in Religious Studies and English (and proudly admits she has never once had to do a pset at her time at Brown), with unclear goals of what she wants to do with either degree. She is also a part of the Presidential Scholars Program and the Latinx Student Union (when she remembers to go to the events) When she’s not having a super fun time with the band, Isabella is typically a homebody who enjoys watching compilations of Hell's Kitchen, video essays, and reading literature of sometimes dubious quality.

bio = "Ian hails from the great county of Westchester, NY, about an hour north of NYC—no, don’t even think about trying to say, “so you’re from upstate then?” Go look at a map. He currently plays the clarinet but is learning the tenor sax (and is hoping this endeavor will last more than 5 weeks). His plans are to concentrate somewhere within the humanities, although exactly where is questionable, and he definitely does question it everyday. When not at band, you’ll probably see him lifting at the gym, pondering his future, or debating over the merits of Vdub’s powdered eggs (there are very few merits). He plans on trying every single food item at the Brown dining halls over the course of his four years here—What is food poisoning, anyway? He’s super excited for big things in the upcoming year. Come say hi if you see him around!"

year = 28
bio = "Ryan is from Ellicott City, MD, where he is reportedly classified as a rural student for Brown’s student demographics despite his hometown having over ten boba stores per capita. That esteemed gentleman plays the mellophone, resigned to the fact that he will not touch a french horn in his time at university. He is also the band’s dance captain, though he does not know what the dance captain does. Ryan studies Applied Math-Economics, because he quite enjoys math and economics. He was unaware of the other connotations that came with such a degree. Outside of band, Ryan is also part of the club Taekwondo team and goes to labor rallies with the Student Labor Alliance every so often. If you look closely at the lecture captures for certain classes, you can find him playing Balatro or Baldur’s Gate 3 while taking “excellent notes.” He has never been to the moon."

year = 26
bio = "George is from New York City and will absolutely do the accent upon request. He is in the percussion section and mostly plays bass drum. Outside of band, he double concentrates in physics and literary arts, which in practice means that he is either a STEM kid or a humanities kid depending on which is funnier at the moment. He is also a member of AVGE and Tech House, both of which allow him to channel his love of obscure video games no one has ever heard of, and does independent creative writing on the side. (NOT fanfiction. For now, anyway.) Also, yes, he is the guy on the blue button with “Town” written on it. You can come see him getting lunch at V-Dub or hanging out in the general Harkness area."

bio = "Mike (if that even is David Woody Woodeea’s real name) is proudly from Burlington Massachusetts (or as he puts it, the “suburbs of Boston”). At band events, when he’s not watching Jillian watch Kanayo watch the football game or spilling his hot cocoa all over the place, you can find him playing the Alto Sax (except for most of the time when he’s distracted). Outside of band, Mike eternally debates between studying Math-CS and Applied Math, and also claims to study Political Science despite only having taken two political science classes. When he’s not being spotted in the SciLi or Ratty trying to finish his BDH column, you can find him trying to remember how to play the piano in Steinart or watching Seinfeld, the greatest show on Earth."
