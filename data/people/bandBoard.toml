bio = "Coral is a rabbit-fanatic from Menlo Park, CA–the most silicon of valleys, where avocado toast is essential to life. Yes, she has two pet rabbits, and she will show you pictures of them at any given chance. If you ever see a woman having late-night conversations with the wild rabbits on campus while walking back to her dorm, it’s probably just Coral. In Band, you might hear her “melodious” screeching on the piccolo. Coral is studying Electrical Engineering, mostly because of her love for the letter E. Outside of Band, she doesn’t do anything. Just kidding! She also enjoys playing Club Water Polo, swimming, destroying her friends in every single board game, attending various concerts both on and off campus, and shamelessly plugging the Band."

year = 28
bio = "Ella is from Barrington, Rhode Island, which is fondly recognized by the Brown student body for that one beach you go to freshman year and then never again. Seriously, guys. Barrington Beach is not all that. In band, she can be found playing the cymbals and pretending she isn’t making parts up on the fly. Ella studies Geochemistry, which she swears isn’t an excuse to play with shiny rocks. When not lurking in the Geochem basement, you might spot her rowing on the Seekonk (yes, she’s a coxswain, what gave it away?), camping the Ratty in wait for Jello Night, or playing Roblox horror games with her friends. Ask her about umbrellas."

year = 29
bio = "Anya is from the little town of Boxborough, Massachusetts but she usually just says ‘the suburbs of Boston.’ Like any good new englander, Anya loves hiking, dunkin, and complaining loudly about driving in Boston. In Band, Anya plays the clarinet, and is definitely really good at it, and all her mistakes are the reed’s fault. Anya is studying Earth, Climate, and Biology with naive and hopeful dreams of saving us all from the wrath of big oil. She would also love to be an art history major but also wants a job in the future, so maybe her career choices need work. Outside of band, Anya plays bass clarinet in Brown's wind symphony, just joined the ballroom dance team, and loves backpacking even though it has already destroyed her knees."

bio = "Sophie is from the incredibly populous state of Delaware, where at least one other student at Brown probably also calls home. She was told to play the tuba in sixth grade and has enjoyed playing an instrument that makes her feel very tall ever since. She is studying Materials Engineering because she loves concrete. She has strong feelings about traffic infrastructure and pedestrian crossings and would like to share them with you. Sophie has a lot of love in her heart. Sophie can recite certain poems and always does the NYT Monday crossword. When she’s not at band, you can find Sophie on the phone with her brothers, in the kitchen making “recipes”, or touching grass."

year = 27
bio = "Owen is from the sleepy Providence suburb of New York City, and has thus wasted much of his one precious life watching the Giants lose on TV. He makes up for it by pounding out mostly accurate quarter notes on the bass drum without even looking at the conductor. Owen studies creative writing and linguistics, the latter of which has taught him that “Please play quieter” is an infelicitous speech act that can safely be ignored. Outside of the Band, you can find Owen singing bass in the Brown University “No Cymbals Allowed” Chorus, getting lost on the 30-second commute from King House to Fulton, and contracting tetanus from his vintage Band buttons."

bio = "Shun is a California-resident gremlin who hates anyone from LA and the word “bay-area.” Chances are, you might see him using a meal swipe to take 5 ice teas back to his dorm, because his bloodstream is practically half sugar. In the band, you will observe this strange creature congregating around the clarinet section and holding a strange black instrument in his hands. While out of the band, he studies biochemistry for his future goal of creating a super disease, then profitting off of creating its vaccine. His hobbies include calling people with glasses “four-eyes,” kicking elevator doors to make Coral nervous, and games of the board/video kind."
