link = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CU-NX7im4"
year = 25
bio = "Jimmy is from Middletown, RI (despite the numerous times he has said he’s from Newport), and as a proud Rhode Islander, Jimmy is always quick to address haters of the state. In Band, he plays tenor sax and dabbles in soprano sax when he wants to channel his inner Kenny G. Jimmy studies Mathematics and Computer Science so he’s destined to be a sellout or a struggling academic. When not in Band, trying to count imaginary numbers or stressing about life after school, Jimmy is an avid soup and caffeine enjoyer and can occasionally be found in the ratty with a bowl of soup, but is more likely than not sipping on some highly caffeinated drink."

year = 26
bio = "Eitan is from NYC, which has prepared him well for moving large groups of people and talking very loudly. He usually plays snare (roll off, 2, 3, 4!) although this term may be the start of a new era of cymbals. Eitan currently studies Music, along with a constant variety of potential second concentrations. Outside of the Band, he’s also on the board for the Fermata Composer’s Collective, occasionally scores films for Brown Motion Pictures, and plays percussion in BUCO and AVGE! When not making large amounts of noise, you might find him pretending to still be an English major (trying to finally finish writing this book draft), enjoying a quiet afternoon with friends at the Vdub, or watching another movie at 1:00am."

year = 27
bio = "Coral is a rabbit-fanatic from Menlo Park, CA–the most silicon of valleys, where avocado toast is essential to life. Yes, she has two pet rabbits, and she will show you pictures of them (and give you insights into her unnecessarily vast depth of rabbit knowledge) at any given chance. If you ever see a woman having late-night conversations with the wild rabbits on campus while walking back to her dorm, it’s probably just Coral. In Band, you might barely be able to hear her on the flute, desperately playing passages an octave higher in an effort to be heard. While not entirely decided on a concentration, she hopes to study engineering at Brown. Outside of Band, Coral doesn’t do anything. Just kidding! She also plays in the Brown University Chamber Orchestra, swims with Brown’s club team, and destroys her friends in every single board game at Brown Table. Additionally, she enjoys doing NYT crossword puzzles and word games, listening to classical music (alongside many other genres), partying with friends, and shamelessly plugging the Band."

year = 27
bio = "Alison is from Missouri City, Texas (advertised as a land of genial sunshine and eternal summer, but really just a suburb of Houston). Please ask her about Buc-ee’s. She “plays” the cymbals, after first picking them up with the bribe of ice cream and the idea of hitting things. She plans to concentrate in Computer Science and Linguistics (and either be super rich or underlyingly employed. #sellout). In her free time, Alison naps in ungodly amounts, carries on the Swiftie Band Board legacy, and writes poetry for funsies."

year = 26
bio = "Owen is from North Providence, RI, which is a separate town from Providence, despite the fact that he lets those who are none the wiser think he’s from Providence. In Band, he plays Bari Sax, which much like North Providence’s status as a separate town, receives a “What? That’s a thing?” as a response from the ill informed. Outside of Band, Owen studies Biomedical Engineering, with plans to build weapons of mass destruction and take over the world. That was a joke. Maybe(Raytheon jobs look real nice for an engineer down on his luck). Owen spends his free time mostly split between playing electric bass for Brown’s Anime Video Game Ensemble, and serving as the Projects Manager for Tech House(recruitment starts spring semester!!!). If you happen to see Owen out in the wild, odds are he probably won’t recognize you, due to not having consumed his 5th cup of coffee of the day yet, and having stayed up till 3 A.M. doing a combination of Japanese and Engineering homework."

year = 27
bio = "Mia is from the tropics of Honolulu, Hawai‘i, but likes to refer to herself as a “city girl” because there’s more than 20 buildings within a 100-mile radius of her house. Despite constantly roasting Rhode Island for its depressing gray beaches, when at home, she would rather stay inside watching Criminal Minds than make a five-minute trek down to the beach. In Band, Mia plays the Euphonium as part of the “low brass besties.” Outside of music, she is thinking about concentrating in some type of engineering (for BDW 3D-printing privileges, respectfully). You might find Mia pondering life by the Providence River or napping on her pset in a Page-Rob seminar room. If not, she’s probably curled up in a ball on a random lounge chair, also taking a nap."
