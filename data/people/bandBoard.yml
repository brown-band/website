  bio: |
    Born and raised in the great (?) state of Tennessee, Stacey’s most notable life achievement is somehow completing 7/8ths of a physics degree and 4/9ths of an APMA degree despite only being able to do math by smell. Although she’s played clarinet for almost 10 years now, in the band she plays mellophone because she enjoys obscuring her vision with large pieces of metal. Her favorite activities outside of the band include having Infinite Jest read to her by Sean Pratt’s disembodied voice, consuming increasingly esoteric pieces of media, and writing long sentences like this one.

    Victoria is a Rural Student™ (#cityfolkjustdon’tgetit) from Hillsboro, West Virginia, and her primary purpose in life is informing you all that Appalachia is pronounced appa-LATCH-uh, NOT appa-lay-shuh. She will fight you on this, and she will win.

    Now that that’s cleared up, here are some other things you should know about her! She’s concentrating in Geology-Biology (geology because rocks are cool, biology because they’re not that cool) and also something else TBD that’s more in the social~~ist~~ sciences direction (because she’s confused™). In the Band, she plays the instrument with the greatest capacity to accidentally whack you in the back of the head, otherwise known as the trombone, but also sometimes heavier and less deadly instruments like the baritone and the tuba. When she’s not vice-presiding over the Band’s various shenanigans (she-Band-igans, if you will), she enjoys bad puns, taking selfies with Dairy Cow (her pet sheep), being paralyzed with delight at the sight of large dogs, and dreaming of dropping out of school to hike the Appalachian trail and/or run her own bakery.

    Susan was born and raised in Boston, MA (the actual city and not some suburb, which is, in fact, important) and has several strong opinions about 1) the Patriots and 2) clam chowder. After conducting a thorough vibe check, the only concentrations she deemed passable were Environmental Science and Urban Studies, which she now finds herself pursuing. A proud member of the trumpet section, she basks in the glory of being loud but would nevertheless like to apologize to anyone who has ever stood in front of her. When not tending to her motherly duties, Susan can be found playing Tetris (1v1 me you coward), rewatching the live-action Dora movie, and thinking about Obi-Wan Kenobi.

    Abby is from Welcome, Minnesota (yes, that is the name of the town, and yes, there is a sign that says ‘welcome to welcome’ in case you were wondering). In her freetime, she likes to crochet and bake cookies because she secretly is an old lady. At Brown, Abby studies archaeology because getting paid to lick bones and dig in the dirt is her dream. In the band, she plays the flute, the section which can’t be heard 69% of the time (the other 31% consists of the solo in Al and the high notes that only dogs and children can hear).

    Sara hails from little ol' RI but really doesn’t like sand very much. It’s coarse, and rough, and irritating. And It gets everywhere. She’s concentrating in Literary Arts & English Nonfiction, and wowee does she find writing in the third person exhilarating. As well as sending out weekly emails to the band, she also enjoys blowing noise with the trumpet section, wearing pants that are a little bit too long, and drinking viscous liquids. Froot loops are all the same flavor and it’s impossible to hum while holding your nose.
