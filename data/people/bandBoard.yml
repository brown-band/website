    Adeline is from Fairfield, Montana (population of cows > population of people (700)) and will fight you if you claim that North Dakota or Idaho are even remotely comparable to her great state. In true Montana form, she is a big fan of country music, snow, and cows. In the band, she plays an instrument no one can hear (clarinet) but successfully combats that by being consistently flat. Someday she aspires to have a clarinet section loud enough even the trumpets can hear them! She’s an IAPA (international and public affairs) concentrator (and secretly BEO (business)) and will someday use the two degrees to successfully understand how to file taxes. Outside of band she enjoys baking, fresh snow, and the concept of running!

    Shaw claims to be from Boston, but a thorough cross-examination reveals he is, in fact, from Newton Massachusetts, not actual Boston. An avid rock-licker, he’s a geo-bio concentrator because rocks rock (hehe) and would like you to know lenticular clouds = ufos. In band, Shaw plays the loudest instrument, trumpet (protect your ears! Stay far away!) In his free time, he can be found biking. All the time. And talking about bikes. And watching bike videos. And dreaming about bikes. Or skiing if it’s too cold for his bikes to be outside. He’s a certified EMT to combat his frequent biking and skiing injuries and enjoys pretending to be a bartender, stealing bananas from a certain dining hall, and good chaos.

    Noah “Mama Vaughan” is from Litchfield New Hampshire and as a resident of a very pretty but frigid wasteland is Never Cold. Ever. He’s concentrating in Biomedical Engineering. Biomedical to eradicate spiders (or become spider man), and engineering because, hey, did you know how they made the steel overhang on the new performing arts center? It’s so cool! When he’s not handing out bandaids and water to the band, he’s playing saxophone and attempting to not fall down during ice rehearsal. Outside of band, Noah is a fan of climbing, The Office,  and everything memey.

    Richie (that’s Richard if the person reading this is a coworker) comes from the city of Dallas in the great Texas Republic where everything is bigger— the brains, boyish charm, the blaring voices in his head that interfere with his daily interactions. A defensive driver but offensive pedestrian, he’ll fearlessly lead the drumline into oncoming traffic, though he often has to put down the tenors for a break because yesterday was leg day. When he’s not beefing up his body, this APMA-ECON (Applied Math & Economics) concentrator enjoys beefing up his stock portfolio and eventually hopes to fly the band out to the San Diego NCAA game. After his top two priorities of band and gym are fulfilled, he’s always down for some video games, a pool party, or simply reflecting on the passage of time.

    Victoria is a Rural Student™ (#cityfolkjustdon’tgetit) from Hillsboro, West Virginia, and her primary purpose in life is informing you all that Appalachia is pronounced appa-LATCH-uh, NOT appa-lay-shuh. She will fight you on this, and she will win.

    Now that that’s cleared up, here are some other things you should know about her! She’s concentrating in Geology-Biology (geology because rocks are cool, biology because they’re not that cool) and Education. In the Band, she plays the instrument with the greatest capacity to accidentally whack you in the back of the head, otherwise known as the trombone, but also sometimes heavier and less deadly instruments like the baritone and the tuba. When she’s not cor-seccing over the Band’s various shenanigans (she-Band-igans, if you will), she enjoys bad puns, taking selfies with Dairy Cow (her pet sheep), being paralyzed with delight at the sight of large dogs, and dreaming of dropping out of school to hike the Appalachian trail and/or run her own bakery.

- position:
    name: Recording Secretary
    sec: IIIA2RecSec
    role: The Recording Secretary (better known as RecSec and better spelled as WreckSec) takes attendance at rehearsals and on roadtrips, maintains databases of band alumni and contributors, keeps Band Board meeting notes, sends weekly band notices, and picks up the slack.

    Corrin hails from Alexandria, Virginia (\~just outside of DC\~ she'll say, but don't let anyone actually from DC hear her say it).  In the band, she primarily plays flute, but is also slowly colonizing the rest of the band, currently squeaking out notes on the clarinet and attempting to learn the trumpet (and she plays 8 other instruments beyond those!) Corrin is concentrating in linguistics with a focus in psycholinguistics, and no, she can't speak any other languages :(, though she has dabbled in a variety of different language classes over the years. She has plans to become a speech-language pathologist after college. In her free time outside of writing colorful emails to the bandies, Corrin can be found being really good at Mario Kart, really bad at knitting and crocheting, and being so-so at dying her hair.
