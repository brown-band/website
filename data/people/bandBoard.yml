    Jillian is from a town on the “New York” side of Connecticut (proud home of the Stupid Building™). In the Band you might be able to hear her playing the flute if you listen very closely. But only in that one song. Maybe. Elsewhere on campus, she plays the most duck-sounding of all the instruments: the oboe. Jillian studies Computational Biology (Biology because genetics! And pipetting! And Computational because she gets to decorate her laptop with stickers). In her free time, you may find her skating (roller or ice), exploring the city of Providence, and starting (and sometimes finishing) various art projects.

    Jommy, sorry, Jimmy, is from the town of Middletown, RI located (just as you guessed) in the middle of Newport and Portsmouth. Besides the native Rhode Islander activities of drinking coffee milk and being a “bad” driver, Jimmy is part of S&M where he plays the superior sax (tenor). Outside of Band, Jimmy is a APMA-CS concentrator so you’ll probably hear him complaining about his next PSET or CS project that’s due soon. You may catch him eating soup at the ratty, or sipping an Aroma Joe’s energy drink. If you don’t, he’s probably looking at sax gear or at home cause he can do that.

    Albert proudly hails from Toronto, Canada and is a freshman at Brown. Yes, he plays ice hockey. Yes, he is sometimes unnecessarily apologetic. Yes, he firmly believes ketchup potato chips are elite. Albert plays the alto sax at an extremely sub-par level and first picked up the instrument for middle school band because his mother had a crush on Kenny G. Although undecided on a concentration, he is currently considering studying economics or political science. Outside of music and academics, Albert enjoys amateur running, cooking, and creative writing.

    Devon calls Colville–a small town located in the northeast corner of the amazing state of Washington–his home… and to answer your question before it gets asked, NO! it is not close to Seattle. While home, enjoying the “much better vibes of the west coast” he is an avid skier and even is on his local ski area’s ski patrol! He also enjoys hiking, biking and getting up way too early to go for morning runs. He is concentrating in Public Health and is pre-med; despite this he does actually have a life outside of studying (or so he says). In Band he plays trombone as part of the section he likes to call “low brass besties.” Outside of band, you’ll find him studying in the Hay, hanging with other rural students, listening to Taylor Swift, or doing research at the Brown-Lifespan Center for Digital Health! Slayyy.

    Sophia is from Long Island, New York, but often enjoys omitting the “Long Island” part to innocently let others assume that she’s from NYC. But of course, she will admit that she lives _just outside_ the city, only if asked. She plays trumpet in the band, where she’ll add jazz licks to any band song that’s even the slightest bit jazzy. When she’s not busy writing emails ending with the controversial one word “evertrue,” Sophia can be found drinking bubble tea or chai lattes, writing songs in the style of Taylor Swift, or overanalyzing episodes of Friends. She plans to concentrate in English and History, and she dreams of becoming a writer after college. Writing what? No idea!
