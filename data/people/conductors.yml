  bio: |
    Ethan is from the small town of River Falls in Wisconsin: a state with three times as many bars as grocery stores and 2.8 billion pounds of cheese produced yearly. In the band, he can be found making “music” with the sousaphone and conducting. He also plays euphonium in the Wind Symphony and trombone with The Bear Bones. Music has always been a big part of Ethan’s life, including composing, performing with the 2019 Madison Scouts, and creating increasingly obscure music playlists. He enjoys reducing people to math problems, and as such is concentrating in APMA/ECON. Outside of music, Ethan can be found filling his brain with useless trivia about US presidents, playing Minecraft, doing origami, and losing to his sister at badminton.

    Kanayo is proud to call the great state of Maryland home, and lives ~in a pineapple under the sea~ in a city called Silver Spring. Like any true Marylander he loves crabs (both watching and eating) and desires to put Old Bay seasoning on every food item he consumes. Kanayo is only a wee freshman but has already fallen in love with the band and its amazing spirit. He loves conducting and is very excited to be a baby conductor for the next few years! When not conducting you can find him playing the mellophone, French horn, or a variety of other brass instruments. If you’re lucky, you may also find him pulling his hair out in a dark room because he’s concentrating in Biochemistry (which he does love despite his lack of hair). If you are _very_ lucky you may find him secretly pursuing his other passion of baseball on the club baseball team!
