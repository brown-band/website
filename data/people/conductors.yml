    Malachi is from beautiful Nevada (Nuh-vae-duh), Iowa. He still needs to decide what kind of engineering he wants to do, but will probably pick mechanical or electrical. He enjoys running, or swimming when he's hurt (about 50% of the time tbh), cheering for the Iowa State cyclones, eating pickles, and the color pink. In the band he plays the trombone, which is undeniably the coolest instrument. Spread and wail.

    Béatrice is from the suburbs of Seattle, Washington, but her family is originally from Québec, Canada, which you will surely hear a lot about. From first learning the flute in 5th grade to being drum major in high school, band has been a huge part of Béatrice’s life and she is so excited to be a conductor of the Brown University “best in the land” Band! She hopes to double concentrate in American Studies and History of Art and Architecture, but we’ll see what happens (it just sure as hell won’t be STEM)! Other passions include museums, NBC Sitcoms, bubble tea, and watching far too much YouTube.

    Dana Danza Dan is from San Jose, California (nORCal) and is super excited to be a (i'm babey) conductor. Outside of the band, she loves her do-good kirb and is hopefully concentrating in music and econ/cs?/"i have no idea?. By the time she graduates, she plans to convert the entire band into K-pop. :^)
