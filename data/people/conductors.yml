    While Béatrice is from the suburbs of Seattle, her entire family is originally from Québec, a fact that you will surely hear a lot about because she never shuts up about being Canadian. From first learning the flute in 5th grade to being drum major in high school, band has always been a huge part of Béatrice’s life and she is so excited to be a head conductor of the Brown University “no we don’t actually march but we do wake you up at 8 am occasionally” band! Outside of band, Béatrice is double concentrating in American Studies and the History of Art and Architecture and works as a curatorial assistant to the university curator, as well as a tour guide. Other passions include chai lattés from the ERC café, NBC sitcoms and SNL, collaging, Timothée Chalamet, bubble tea, watching far too much YouTube, and being a member of Bachelor nation.

    Kanayo is proud to call the great state of Maryland home, and lives ~~in a pineapple under the sea~~ in a city called Silver Spring. Like any true Marylander he loves crabs (both watching and eating) and desires to put Old Bay seasoning on every food item he consumes. Kanayo is only a wee freshman but has already fallen in love with the band and its amazing spirit. He loves conducting and is very excited to be a baby conductor for the next few years! When not conducting you can find him playing the mellophone, French horn, or a variety of other brass instruments. If you’re lucky, you may also find him pulling his hair out in a dark room because he’s concentrating in Biochemistry (which he does love despite his lack of hair). If you are very lucky you may find him secretly pursuing his other passion of baseball on the club baseball team!

    Ethan is from River Falls, Wisconsin (think Minneapolis, then hop over the Wisconsin border) and a member of the class of 2024! He plays one of the coolest but also most confusing instruments, trombone (no keys, just sound) and studies something. It’s a secret.
