bio = "Aly hails from Canada - a fact which some find obvious and others unbelievable. In Band, he plays the flute melodica and dabbles in arranging. Aly plans on studying Mathematics, because he loves numbers, and Computer Science, so that he has the option of selling out. Beyond that, here are some quick facts: he regularly rewatches the Kung Fu Panda trilogy (the fourth movie doesn’t count); he thinks sudoku and 2048 are the greatest games ever created; he once drew a mouse, which his mother confused for an elephant; and he loves being part of the Brown Band!"

endowed = "Nicholas J Everage Student Conductor"
bio = "Everton is a PROUD New Yorker…and no, he isn’t from the city! He grew up in a town on Long Island called Valley Stream, which isn’t located in a valley and only has a teeny tiny creek. In the band, you can find him questioning why he chose to play the sousaphone in elementary school, an instrument he still struggles to hold up. Everton began his conducting journey in front of a mirror while listening to anime music, but fervently enjoys waving his hands in front of an actual band as an assistant conductor! Outside of music, he is concentrating in Political Science and Hispanic Studies. You can often find Everton playing tennis at the courts on campus, procrastinating on his phone in the Rock Stacks/SciLi upper floors, or watching a show on Netflix (he is currently binging the Crown…RIP Queen Lizzie!)."

bio = "Sarah comes from good ol’ Levittown, Pennsylvania (yes, the one from your history class) and is VERY proud of her Philly roots (except when the Phillies let her down again). When not conducting you can find her playing ~~mellophone~~ trumpet and struggling to find the correct song in her flip folder before we start playing. Sarah currently plans on studying Geochemistry or Environmental Science. She’ll decide eventually. Outside of band, you can find Sarah copyediting and handling social media for the Brown Daily Herald, at Dave’s Coffee fueling her caffeine addiction, or listening to her 7-hour-long, solely Taylor Swift playlist (or her 10-hour-long jazz playlist aptly named “Chet Baker is so hot”). Sarah’s super excited to continue in band as a baby conductor and cannot wait to go to more games!"
