bio = "Everton is a PROUD New Yorker…and no, he isn’t from the city! He grew up in a town on Long Island called Valley Stream, which isn’t located in a valley and only has a teeny tiny creek. Besides conducting, in the band, you can find him attempting to hold a sousa, which is especially a sight to see during field and ice shows. Everton began his conducting journey in front of a mirror while listening to anime intros, but fervently enjoys waving his hands in front of an actual band! Outside of music, he is concentrating in Political Science and Hispanic Studies. You can often find Everton playing tennis at the courts on campus, procrastinating on his phone in the Rock Stacks/SciLi upper floors, or binging a show on Hulu/Netflix (he always needs a good recommendation!!!)"

year = 28
endowed = "Nicholas J Everage Student Conductor"
bio = "Sarah hails from good ol’ Levittown, Pennsylvania, the suburbiest of Philadelphia suburbs! Speaking of Philadelphia, Go Birds! In band, you may find Sarah playing ~~mellophone~~ trumpet, laughing at her own jokes, or crashing out over the football team. Sarah is planning to concentrate in Geochemistry and Environmental Chemistry, which is definitely not just an excuse to look at fun rocks all day. She also gets access to fun radioactive chemicals! When not trapped in Macmillan by this little thing called “employment,” you can find Sarah looking for a place to fuel her caffeine addiction (she yearns for a Dunkin on Thayer), listening to audiobooks, thrifting, or picking flowers like a whimsical child."

link = "null"
year = 29
bio = "Emah comes from the swamps of Louisiana, and if you ask her, she'll tell you that she doesn’t have the Louisiana accent because she “ain’t from down da bayou.”  In band, she plays the mellophone (#fellomello), but if you lose sight of her, just follow the trail of people with braided hair.  You’ll find her braiding the hair of her next victim. Emah is planning on concentrating in Education Studies and Applied Mathematics to become a high school math teacher.  Outside of academics, she loves to go to the drag strip because _we like the cars, the cars that go vroom._  If a “cool” car or motorcycle passes by, she’ll start rambling as if she knows anything about cars; however, she really only knows how to drive stick shift.  And she’ll never let you forget that she has her motorcycle endorsement, as if those words mean anything when you don’t own a motorcycle."
