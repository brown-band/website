bio = "Kanayo is proud to call the great state of Maryland home, and lives ~in a pineapple under the sea~ in a city called Silver Spring. Like any true Marylander he loves crabs (both watching and eating) and desires to put Old Bay seasoning on every food item he consumes. Kanayo is only a wee freshman but has already fallen in love with the band and its amazing spirit. He loves conducting and is very excited to be a baby conductor for the next few years! When not conducting you can find him playing the mellophone, French horn, or a variety of other brass instruments. If you’re lucky, you may also find him pulling his hair out in a dark room because he’s concentrating in Biochemistry (which he does love despite his lack of hair). If you are _very_ lucky you may find him secretly pursuing his other passion of baseball on the club baseball team!"

endowed = "Nicholas J Everage Student Conductor"
bio = "Aly hails from the Great White North, and will vehemently defend his homeland from all who challenge it. In Band, he plays the melodica and is desperately trying to classify the section as distinct from the flutes. Aly plans on studying Mathematics, because he loves numbers, and Computer Science, so that he always has the option of selling out. Other than that, here are some quick facts: he once drew swans on a lake and his mother asked him why the sheep were swimming; he never gets bored of rewatching the Kung Fu Panda trilogy (soon to be tetralogy); he thinks sudoku and 2048 are the greatest games ever created; and he loves being part of the Brown Band."

link = "null"
year = 27
bio = "Everton is from Valley Stream, NY, a town that isn’t actually located in a valley and only has a teeny tiny creek. In the band, you can find him struggling to hold up the sousaphone; however, he plans on learning a lighter instrument…the piano. Everton began his conducting journey by waving his hands in front of a mirror while listening to anime intros, but he is ready to continue with an actual band as a baby conductor! Outside of music, he is interested in concentrating in Political Science and, possibly, Hispanic Studies. You can often find Everton playing tennis at the courts on campus or procrastinating on his phone in the SciLi basement."
